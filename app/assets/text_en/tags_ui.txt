tagFactionSurvivorsInfo=Headquarters: Devil's Crossing {^n}{^n} Survivors...that is the word used most often to describe the hardy denizens of Devil's Crossing. The men and women who made it through the Grim Dawn to form a small community within the ruins of an abandoned prison. They have seen all too many friends and family lost to the "Taken", those found possessed by the Aetherials.{^n}{^n} Earning their trust will prove no easy task, but with supplies running low and a looming Aetherial threat on the horizon, they may just be willing to take a chance.

tagFactionAetherials=Aetherials
tagFactionAetherialsInfo= Foolishly and greedily did the arcanists of Cairn delve into the magical veil known as the Aether, never once suspecting that something was looking back. {^n}{^n} The Aetherials descended upon Cairn in what is now known as the Grim Dawn, possessing countless humans and butchering the rest. Most despicably of all, they began raising the fallen as mutated undead creatures, mindless foot soldiers for their invasion. Their very presence on Cairn is enough to mutate the wildlife, turning once docile creatures into vicious monstrosities. {^n}{^n} But most strange of all is their apparent hatred for Chthonians, as they will battle against the horrors from the Void at every opportunity.

tagFactionCthoniansInfo= Chthonians, horrors from the Void, are the things of nightmares. Prior to the Grim Dawn, Chthonians would only be seen upon Cairn following an arcane ritual gone wrong or at the beckoning of a powerful sorcerer. {^n}{^n} Despite an effort to exterminate the practice, a cult has formed around blood rituals and the worship of Chthonic beings. Members of the cult have been overheard chanting one name in particular: Ch'thon. With the world in disarray, the cult has grown strong, garnering new followers desperate for answers in a world that no longer makes sense. {^n}{^n} Chthonians, and their loyal cult, appear to be at odds with the Aetherials, eagerly harvesting helpless humans for blood so that the Aetherials cannot use them as vessels.

tagFactionOutlawsInfo= Unlike most groups of roaming bandits, Cronley's Gang appears to be highly organized and heavily armed, answering only to their self-proclaimed leader, Darius Cronley. {^n}{^n} Having escaped Devil's Crossing Prison following the chaos that ensued after the Grim Dawn, these criminals are now intent on taking the one place in the world that once denied them their freedom. Members of Cronley's Gang are sadistic, violent and prone to acts of aggression against their fellow humans, epitomizing that perhaps the greatest threat to humanity is humanity itself.

tagFactionUser0=Rovers
tagFactionUser0Info=Headquarters: Old Arkovia {^n}{^n} The Rhowari, or Rovers as they are commonly called, are a group of people without a permanent home. To them, the open road is the only home they will ever need, traveling the world of Cairn in a lifelong pilgrimage to cleanse themselves of worldly temptations and the corruption of civilization. Much of their history had been lost to the ages, and most cultures consider them to be little more than vagrants and petty thieves. {^n}{^n} Rovers abhor violence, and will try to avoid it at any cost, which has often led to abuse at the hands of more violent individuals.

tagFactionUser2Info=Headquarters: Homestead {^n}{^n} Whenever trouble would strike the northern farmlands, the farmers and their families would rally at Homestead. This sense of community has proven more important than ever as humanity faces extinction. {^n}{^n} With assistance from the Black Legion, Homestead was turned into a veritable fortress, a place of relative safety in a world ravaged by death; but with powerful enemies encroaching from every direction, some are beginning to wonder if entrenching in a fixed location was a wise decision. {^n}{^n} While the Black Legion obsesses over the Aetherials and the Chthonians, the people of Homestead are focused on a threat much closer to home: the voracious Dermapteran swarm, which has spread rampantly and now infests their abandoned fields.

She seemingly arrived out of nowhere, providing the Black Legion with information on enemy activity that has saved precious lives. {^n}{^n} Many in the Black Legion have branded her a witch, and would gladly see her burnt at the stake despite Inquisitor Creed's insistence that she be kept safe.

tagFactionUser5=Order of Death's Vigil
tagFactionUser5Info=Headquarters: Sorrow's Bastion {^n}{^n} The Order of Death's Vigil represents the last connection to the nearly lost art of necromancy, precious knowledge passed down to its members from their grandmaster, Uroboruuk. {^n}{^n} Members of the Order do not fear death. Instead they embrace all of its harsh lessons, believing that through mastery of death they can become more in tune with the world itself. {^n}{^n} Having faced persecution at the hands of the empire for centuries, the Order is no stranger to prejudice and controversy, but they had never met a foe as relentless as the Kymon's Chosen. The Chosen, concerned only with cleansing Cairn of corruption, view the Order as a travesty that must be purged.

tagFactionUser6=Arkovian Undead
tagFactionUser6Info=Many tragic tales are told about the undead endlessly roaming the ruins of Arkovia. Some believe them to be spirits trapped within the mortal realm, unable to cross over into their promised afterlife. Others will claim it to be the work of vile necromancy, a legion of undead cursed to serve a cruel master. Perhaps the truth lies somewhere in-between. {^n}{^n} One thing everyone can agree upon is that the undead are extremely dangerous to the living. As such, looting their forgotten ruins is considered to be an ill-advised pursuit.

Legends of their valor intermingle with equally common tales of their cruelty and violence. {^n}{^n} Regardless of whether they are respected or feared, the Black Legion was the only imperial regiment to escape the fallen capital following the Grim Dawn and may now represent the only hope humanity has left of ever fighting back.

To this end, they consider ridding the world of the Order of Death's Vigil to be one of their utmost priorities.
