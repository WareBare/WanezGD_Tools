#Journals

tagGDX1LoreObj_InquisitorCreedA09Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 9th Entry
tagGDX1LoreObj_InquisitorCreedA09codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 9th Entry
tagGDX1LoreObj_InquisitorCreedA09Text=With the help of the Taken, we've dealt a serious blow to the Cult of Ch'thon. I don't want to diminish the immensity of such a triumph, especially given the small force and limited resources we're working with but I fear it has come at great cost. While our attention was focused on denying the Loghorrean entrance to this world, the Aetherials were certainly not idle.{^n}{^n}Many in Devil's Crossing have paid the ultimate price but such is the way of war and it may sound callous to say but we traded well. Losing only a handful while preventing a monstrosity from escaping the void that could have heralded the end of the world as we know it is a win for humanity.{^n}{^n}What disturbs me though is the loss of Ulgrim to the void. Bourbon apparently does not share my concern and I think he sees it as ill-afforded sentiment on my part. Bourbon sees Ulgrim as merely a man but I am certain there is more to him. I believe he is an ascendant, a man who has become a demi-god.{^n}{^n}Ulgrim expertly plays the part of a jovial and unassuming character but his eyes say much more. He makes off-handed references to historical events with details and a familiarity of someone recalling a personal memory. For all his outward jocularity, there is gravity to him and it is clear he has witnessed much; I suspect more than one could experience in a single lifetime.{^n}{^n}Yet, for all that, and despite his obvious efforts to downplay it, Ulgrim possesses remarkable strength and energy for the middle-aged man he appears to be. He often carries himself in a relaxed, casual manner, moving languidly; but at rare moments, I have seen him react and move with impossible speed.{^n}{^n}I feel that he could do much more than he has, in fighting the enemies of man but I am not sure why he is holding back. Perhaps we will never know now. Maybe Bourbon is right, perhaps Ulgrim is lost to the void. Somehow though, I feel we will see him again and, if we do, it would go a long way toward confirming my suspicions.{^n}{^n}Then again, strange times are these, where a nameless wretch, cut down from the noose, has risen to become possibly the greatest hero of our time.{^n}{^n}If the Taken continues on this path and survives this war, I wonder if perhaps they too are on the path of ascendancy.

tagGDX1LoreObj_InquisitorCreedA10Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 10th Entry
tagGDX1LoreObj_InquisitorCreedA10codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 10th Entry
tagGDX1LoreObj_InquisitorCreedA10Text=The Taken has forged a path from Burrwitch, through the Gloomwald, and descended again into the very void itself to resurface with none other than Ulgrim. I find it impossible now to dismiss the idea that he is indeed the Ulgrim of legend and an immortal ascendant.{^n}{^n}As much as I am grateful to have such a powerful ally in this war, I cannot help but feel a little on edge when he is present. Between Ulgrim and the recent rumors of Mogdrogen, I am concerned that other divinities may also begin involving themselves in worldly affairs; as it is said they did more commonly in ancient times.{^n}{^n}This leads me back to the lingering mystery of Kymon. It is apparent that he and his followers are drawing power from some godlike force, but who or what? I am very doubtful of Kymon's claim that it is Empyrion that guides him, as he initially suggested. The power I sensed in Kymon's emissary to Homestead had a feeling of...malevolence to it.{^n}{^n}Kymon was once a brethren inquisitor, but he went rogue in the years before the Grim Dawn. He is clearly not Aetherial, but I fear he's entered into some manner of dark pact with an unknown power. Certainly if Empyrion, the high-god of legend, returned to Cairn, a power such as that would be felt on a larger scale than merely one raving fanatic leading a group of vagabonds.{^n}{^n}None the less, whatever entity is behind Kymon's Chosen, clearly it does possess significant power and I am troubled, not knowing its identity or motivations.

#AreaE Notes
#Barrowholm_01
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A01Name=What does the future hold?
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A01Text=In these trying times, I often find myself in prayer. My mind fills with questions for which there cannot be answers; or, if there are, could we truly be meant to know them?{^n}{^n}The gods work in mysterious ways. Our patron gives and takes, but I believe he is generous to those who follow without question. I now understand the necessities of our existence, that our choices have consequences and that we must bow our heads in reverence for all that we had been given.{^n}{^n}We can never forget that without Him, we would be as nothing. Our homes would be consumed by the waters of the bog and our people devoured by the wendigos that had succumbed to madness. From them, we must take example; for disobedience breeds death, and we must remain resolute in our commitment.

#Barrowholm_02
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A02Name=Aurin's Recipe
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A02Text=A decent cut of meat is a rare sight these days, so it is imperative that we treat every opportunity to feast upon a fresh kill with great reverence. Though I've found cuts from our recent quarries to be a bit tough and lean, they are not entirely unpleasant; much like a freshly slaughtered deer. And while I initially found the taste nauseating, I've become increasingly fond of its delicate layers and nuances.{^n}{^n}As one of the favored among Scorv's company, I've generally had my pick of the best cuts, so I always enthusiastically go for a butchered portion of leg or upper arm. I ask to leave the bone in, as it really seals in the flavor and keeps the meat juicy after cooking. Nevertheless, my recent experimentations reveal that a shorter cooking time is by far the most satisfying.{^n}{^n}With the addition of some finely chopped black onions and a gentle sprinkling of Wightmire herbs seared alongside the meat, the still bloody cuts make for an exquisite experience that is the envy of everyone in Barrowholm. The critical trick is to sear it on the outside while leaving the inside still dripping with juices.{^n}{^n}Scorv himself said that my inspirations could cure even a ravaging hunger, but I know he just says this to keep up our spirits. I am not worthy of such praise.{^n}{^n}-Aurin Evelline

#Barrowholm_03
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A03Name=Through Flesh We Become His Chosen
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A03Text=I did not always relish the taste.{^n}{^n}At first, I found it repugnant. The muscle was tough and the flavor made it difficult to swallow, especially when it was raw. But Scorv insisted that to truly embrace the gifts of the Great One, we must learn to enjoy it in its natural state, rather than resorting to seasonings or flame.{^n}{^n}I was resistant, as were the others, but in time I came around to embrace the feeling of fresh blood seeping between my teeth, the iron taste of gore upon my tongue. Hunger helped that a bit, I'm sure, but now I feel chills at the thought of a fresh victim. I believe this is what Scorv meant when he said we would become closer to our master.{^n}{^n}The thrill, the energy, the change...I can feel the change. It grows inside of me. It began with darkening of the eyes, like a deep crimson. Others further along in their journey have expressed concerns about bone pain throughout the body. Scorv reassures us that this was normal and will pass.{^n}{^n}Whatever changes it brings, I now anticipate them with a nervous joy. I wish only to be closer to Ravager.{^n}{^n}-Olidia

#Barrowholm_04
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A04Name=The Ravager
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Barrowholm_A04Text=Injustice. That is the tale of the Great One. Injustice and betrayal.{^n}{^n}Ravager once walked among us, a beautiful creature, the embodiment of nature's balance. He thrived among his worshippers and bestowed upon them many gifts. But he was not the only one to be blessed with such power.{^n}{^n}The god of beasts grew jealous of Ravager's believers. In the darkness of night, the god sought out Ravager's lair and, with the aid of his slaves, he banished the Great One from this realm.{^n}{^n}Bodiless and forgotten, Ravager threw himself against his spiritual prison. He sought to return to this realm and right the wrongs done to him; and through our sacrifices the day of his judgment has nearly come. We shall become the harbingers of his will, the benefactors of his mercy. And when Ravager's jaws close shut around the throat of the betrayer, so shall we drink of his blood and rise above our lessers.

#DarkWood_01
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA01Name=Bloodsoaked Scribblings
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA01Text=We left Burrwitch not more than a week ago. There was something wrong with that place and there were rumors of strange goings-on around the Krieg residence. So Frasier had this crazy idea that we should leave and head north. He said there was a nice town just up the road. He should know. He lived up there less than a year ago. He said passage would be difficult but we could make it if we stuck together. He couldn't have been more wrong.{^n}{^n}We weren't one day out of town when things started going poorly. First Beatrix came down with a fever. Her skin went pale and her eyes glazed over. That night, she started lashing out at us, shaking, vomiting and screaming about some creature out in the woods staring back at her. The following day, the same thing happened to Heinrich.{^n}{^n}With both of them sick, we were forced to travel slowly. Frasier and I towed them behind us in a makeshift sled. Too far from Burrwitch to turn back, but Frasier said he knew of an inn that was less than a day's travel ahead, so we continued onward. When we reached the inn it was abandoned and the air hung heavy with the scent of death. But we were desperate and in need of shelter so we stayed there nonetheless.{^n}{^n}That night was when the noises started. Frasier said he didn't hear none of it. But I could make it out loud and clear. It sounded like an animal growling and moving about just outside the inn. As the night wore on, the noises became louder and louder and I began to question my sanity. Frasier insisted that it was nothing but I could swear they were right outside. When dawn came, I didn't want to move but Frasier forced me out of the inn. He said we had to continue or we wouldn't make it to safety. So we began pulling the sled north along the overgrown road.{^n}{^n}As we moved I could hear it following us, its footsteps mirroring our own. Beatrix and Heinrich were getting sicker by the minute and we soon grew tired of hauling the sled. My hands were blistered and my feet bloodied from the rough path. Frasier said we had to leave them, the sled was just too heavy for us to pull, but that didn't sit right with me. We argued back and forth about their fate, each becoming more and more angered as we continued. That was when Frasier grabbed his camp hatchet and threatened to kill them right then and there. He said if I wouldn't let them go, he'd just do it for me. I didn't mean for what happened next, but I was scared and the growling sounds bore down on me like a fire in my mind. I shoved him and he stumbled over a root, falling face first into his hatchet which lodged itself in the right side of his chest. He looked up at me in horror as blood filled his lungs and mouth.{^n}{^n}That's when I saw it, standing behind Frasier at the edge of the woods. A massive hideous figure, like a man with the head of a dead animal. I froze for a moment and then bolted down the road. As I ran I could hear Frasier's gurgling screams begging me not to leave him.{^n}{^n}I can still hear them, all three of them wailing in the darkness like rabbits being eaten by a fox. It's been hours, why won't they die? Is that thing still out there? Is it taunting me? I can't go on, I can't take it anymore...

#Darkwood_02
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA02Name=Cratch Moore's Order
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA02Text=There have been some strange travelers about these parts recently. The Inn is busy, more so than it should be this time of year. Not that you'll hear me complaining about that.{^n}{^n}A fair bit of extra coin has found its way to my pockets as of late, but the folk moving through these parts aren't like the ones we're used to seeing. There's been common folk from further south than Devil's Crossing and groups of men and women moving about with strange new markings on their armor and clothes. We even had a fella a couple a weeks back, claimed he came all the way south from the capital. Said he was a chef looking for work. I didn't have room for him, so I suggested he try in Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}It's not just the people that are strange. There's been an uneasy feeling in the forest as I'm sure you've noticed. I haven't seen nor heard a bird in more than a week. I chalked it up to there being more people around but no more than 3 days ago Critch brought in a fresh kill. It was a big swamp buck, 10-points if I remember correctly. A kill like that usually brings in the vultures but the dressings have been sitting out in the wood festering since and no sight of those hideous things. If it sits out much longer it'll draw out Carraxus for sure. I swear that crusty old bastard has doubled in size and gotten twice as ugly since I last saw him. He's been up around the inn twice in the last year, stealing things. Supposedly he even took a milk cow from Gretchen's stable. I shouldn't like to think what happened to that poor thing. Fire used to scare him off but he seems to have become bolder as he's grown. Whoever finds that creature's lair is in for a right heap of useless junk and more crab than a man could eat in a lifetime. If anyone should be eating that thing to begin with.{^n}{^n}In any case, there's business to be done. Especially with all these folk moving about the countryside. If you've got the stores I'd like to order 3 casques of Redmire Ale, 2 cases of Black Leaf, and 20 bottles of Stone Wine.{^n}{^n}Payment on delivery as usual.{^n}{^n}Cratch Moore.

tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA03Text=The words were subtle at first, like an itch in the back of my mind. They were garbled, impossible to make out their meaning. But they would not relent. They became an incessant distraction, a calling much like Malostria's message that once beckoned me to this place; except while the Matron came to me in my dreams, these words are without respite, without end. I can feel my attention waning when performing even rudimentary tasks.{^n}{^n}At times, one voice would rise above the rest in the maddening chorus, and then I could deduce its meaning. This clarity never lasted long and soon the chorus would resume. Never would the same voice gain power over the others. Each time it was as if another sought my ear. They spoke of webs and spiders and places I have never seen nor heard of. Sometimes they woke me in terror as they screamed of fire and vengeance unlike the world had ever seen.{^n}{^n}I spoke of this to the Matron, and her eyes would dart quickly towards old Rugia before staring into mine. She tried to console me as best she could, but we both knew what fate awaits those born with this curse. I only wish I could derive some meaning from the darkness before the madness claims my soul.{^n}{^n}It seems however that it is not to be...

#Coven_02
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA04Name=Trista's Diary
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA04Text=This whole thing is still very strange to me. There are sisters here who have devoted their entire lives to study and craft, but I know nothing of such things. I have no skill with herb and vial, no knowledge of threads or their connections. I have no tales of the Three, or long-sight, I cannot convene with spirits, and yet here I am. I was drawn here like a fish to its spawning grounds and I have no idea why. I don't think any of the sisters know either. I've heard some of the elders speaking of me. There was no disdain in their voices but they too are at a loss for what purpose I have in this place.{^n}{^n}I have learned many things in my short time here and, despite my apparent lack of direction, I intend to absorb as much information as this place will give me. There is a great deal of history in this Coven. I've overheard the eldest sisters speaking of a time when it was first formed, a time when its members were fearless and driven by a hunger for knowledge. They unveiled secrets hidden from mankind, learned of sources of immense power. Together, they achieved things the rest of us dream of, but it came at a heavy price. Their hubris drew the ire of the Three and nothing was ever the same.{^n}{^n}My contemporaries speak of that time in hushed tones, but to be honest I am envious of them. They must have felt such drive, such clarity of purpose. Is it truly so wrong to pursue lost knowledge? I will not rest until I have uncovered their secrets, until these places of power are once again within our grasp. The Witch Gods be damned.But as I walk among my sisters, I realize that there are those among us who look up to the Three with reverence. Through them, the gods retain their unbroken gaze upon this place, and our actions. I must be discreet and unassuming. The mantle of an ill-directed purposeless new recruit shall suit me well, for now.{^n}{^n}

#Altar_01
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA06Name=Gifts of the Gods
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_NoteA06Text=We thought ourselves wise, masters of this craft. But arrogance often precedes tragedy...{^n}{^n}With the Altar of Rattosh, we transcended the rudimentary spellcrafting of our predecessors. We made ourselves younger, stronger, more powerful; but all that paled in comparison to the full potential of the altar. We reached beyond the mortal realm, binding spirits to our will and forcing them to divulge ancient secrets. But even that was not enough. We needed more, and we knew just where to find it: the Eldritch Realm.{^n}{^n}The Eldritch Realm is a strange reality, where the laws of the physical realm do not fully apply and magic runs rampant. The creatures within it are animal-like and yet not. Some are capable of rudimentary magic, some even speak in tongues we cannot fathom. But to us, it was the source of our great magic. To tap into this realm would mean powers beyond imagining. But such arrogant pursuits do not go without notice.{^n}{^n}It was on a full moon that we gathered. Together, we would use the altar and transcend into the Eldritch Realm. This was to be our greatest triumph, but instead it was to be our most humbling moment. At our command, the runes upon the altar began to glow and then...nothing?! The spell spontaneously expired and we were hurled back as a shockwave emanated from its center. Something had arrived.{^n}{^n}Before us stood three horrifying to behold beings. Their mere presence was nearly blinding. And their wrath was absolute. I was forced to watch as my sisters disintegrated in eldritch flames or melted as a thousand eyes stared them into nonexistence. Spiders enveloped another and devoured all but the bones.{^n}{^n}Only we three remained, frozen in terror as the gods we scorned branded us for our arrogance. Then, just as they had arrived, they vanished. At first, we wondered why we were spared, but in time we realized the truth: we lived so that no other would repeat our mistakes.{^n}{^n}If you are reading this, heed our warning. Turn back and leave this haunted place behind. Scour it from your memories, lest the gods return, their wrath unspent.

Something...ancient and forgotten. And like any imprudent mortal, he did not leave what should have remained forgotten alone. A mighty blaze now stirs deep beneath the Korvan Plateau. The beasts of Cairn are restless. They sense it too.{^n}{^n}To compound this mystery, the normally capricious false gods have gone curiously silent. I suspect they've receded to their pocket realm. The timing cannot be fortuitous. The Witch Gods are afraid. Their attention must be drawn to the same power that now consumes the souls of Kymon and his chosen. The mortals' ardent worship feeds it, gives it strength and form.{^n}{^n}Rumblings among the humans speak of the mighty Empyrion's return, but I know that to be the false hopes of helpless wretches. The identity of this forgotten power eludes me, and yet it feels so...familiar.{^n}{^n}What I am certain of however is that cataclysmic change is upon us. I have felt it in the earth. Smelled it upon the wind. Forces I had not sensed in millennia yearn for vengeance and blood.{^n}{^n}I must gather my Rhowari. The time approaches when their conviction will truly be tested.

#Kraken
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Kraken_NoteA01Name=Mysteries of Ugdenbog
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaE_Kraken_NoteA01Text=By decree of the Emperor of Erulan himself, I and my esteemed colleagues were to set out into the wider empire and catalogue the flora and fauna of its vast domain. Little did I think of it at the time, but not all assignments are created equal...as I write this from the dank and foreboding murk of the Ugdenbog, outside of the town of Burrwitch.{^n}{^n}In the three weeks since my arrival, I've already lost two of my escorts to, and I am being dead serious here, plants. Empyrion-forsaken plants. I might add that my specialty has always been in the acute impact of arcane energies upon natural life, not on whether a particular vine is capable of dismembering a man in two while a large bloom consumes another of my team whole!{^n}{^n}If I were not weeks out from Erulan, I would have requested reassignment. The journey was not without merit however, as I did observe some peculiar phenomena along the way; creatures that, while seemingly natural, did not exhibit the standard range of phenotypes one would expect from this region, almost as if they've been plucked out from another place and relocated here within an instant.{^n}{^n}Most fascinating of all has been the talk of the camp for days now, a creature the locals have named Kra'vall, the Ancient of the Waters. Thus far, we've caught but a glimpse of one of its massive tentacles. I can only guess as to the full size of the beast, but it is enormous and quite unlike anything else found within the waters of Ugdenbog.{^n}{^n}Our journey had brought us to what I suspect is its underwater lair and my inquisitor companion immediately began complaining of headaches much like those she's experienced when near heavy concentrations of Eldritch magic. This combined with its unusual appearance leads me to conclude that this creature, and others like it, are Eldritch in nature. But are these manifestations the fickle playthings of the Witch Gods, or perhaps something else entirely?{^n}{^n}-Gallad Nico, Imperial Archivist

He says I should keep a record of days so we might look back on our lives and remember the best times. "These may be the finest of our days my sweet Aimee, best to remember them while we can", he always says. I think he's right and I suppose that's why I keep coming back to this journal.{^n}{^n}He's usually right, I've learned that more and more since we left the city. "The city is too crowded my love, we should leave this place and make our home in the countryside", he said, and so we did. We just packed up whatever we could carry and walked out through the city gates. I was terrified. I couldn't imagine where or how we'd live out here. Malmouth was my home, I was born there amidst the din and grime of the Steelcap District. But Eral was right, the city was too crowded and this countryside is truly beautiful.{^n}{^n}We've found ourselves a small stead, rich land for farming, and more space than anyone could ask for. It's the perfect place to start a family and that's just what we'll be doing. I'm now 2 months pregnant with our first child. It's going to be a girl, I just know it. I've been waiting for the right moment to tell Eral but he's been so busy, toiling about in the farm and traveling back and forth to the city for supplies.

A number of them kept going on about missing family members or people being taken from their homes in the night.

The guard barracks was hit first. They were slaughtered, run through like sleeping hens. Their assailants, horrors like nothing man could imagine. I watched them from my shack, stiff as stone, stricken by what I saw. In mere moments, those things had rid the Candle District of its only hope of defense. Then they poured out onto the streets like a putrid green wave of death. The screams of men and the elderly filled my ears and the air became thick with smoke from the green fires that now washed over the district.{^n}{^n}A strange curiosity urged me to watch. I wanted to see more. So I made my way up to the southern wall, moved silently along it and marveled as death swept through the slums below. Men scattered like legions of roaches and were stomped out by the advancing horde. At first, a small group made it to the southern bridge and crossed before it was raised. The rest fled north to the Crown Hill gates only to find them barred and locked. As the horrors closed in behind them, some climbed the walls in desperation, but its slippery stones were hewn to keep the rabble at bay. Most fell to their deaths, crashing down onto the scrambling masses below. Those few who made it to the top met with the blade of the Crown Hill guards who showed no care for the plight of those beneath.{^n}{^n}The slaughter raged on for a time. Now the slums and hovels are silent. They have begun to sweep the city, collecting corpses of the fallen and corrupting those unfortunate souls who survived.{^n}{^n}I rest here now, with no will to continue, no desire to escape. There is no point. The world stands without hope against such foes and so I will spend my final moments in peace.{^n}{^n}-Rennoch The Rat

My squad and I were fortunate to have been assigned to an overflow area adjacent to the main sleeping quarters, as we were just transferred there the previous day. When the attack started, the captain barged in and began shouting orders at us. Our training took over and we followed, barricading the main door proceeding outside through the back. What awaited us was unthinkable.{^n}{^n}The world was on fire. A foul stench enveloped the city and a putrid green light burned the sky over the Candle District. At dawn we experienced a series of explosions that shook the foundation of the city like a massive earthquake. The scale of these attacks is unthinkable, the damage indescribable.{^n}{^n}At Wilfor's command, we moved silently about the ruins of the city, from barracks to barracks, in search of other guardsmen. But they all contained the same horrific scene: everyone killed in their sleep, at their posts, just slaughtered.{^n}{^n}I'm beginning to fear that we're all that's left. Wilfor ordered us to protect some civilians while he checks nearby for another group of survivors from the city guard.

I asked him where he'd gotten it, and he was naturally mum about it; but threats to his job got through to him right fast. He said he stole it from one of the Crown Hill deliveries, didn't think nothing of it. I had him put it back where he found it.{^n}{^n}I saw it fit to discipline him by half a day's pay, to which he agreed. I don't presume we'll have any more problems from Orith and I do not recommend further punishment. He's a good lad, just stupid.{^n}{^n}That about sums things up for last week. Let me know if this is what you were looking for. I will continue to report on a weekly basis, as requested.{^n}{^n}-Nearan Lehner

tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA11Name=Letter to Ronald Marion
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA11Text=I don't know what Marcell thinks he's doing ousting the council and appointing his cronies to the emptied seats. I cannot imagine a less dignified, more depraved group of individuals has ever served as the leadership of our fine city. What right does he have to return after such long absence, pursuing his own goals in the capital, and begin imposing policy on the high families.{^n}{^n}It has been the birthright of my family to serve on the city council for four generations. I am not about to stand idly by and allow the Marcell family to manipulate the political structure of our city and I do hope you feel the same.{^n}{^n}I will be filing an official complaint directly to the High Council and the Lord Regent's office of Erulan and I ask that you and your house support me in refutation of Theodin Marcell's illegitimate claim to power. I have also heard incredibly disturbing rumors about his "education" at a medical institution there in the capital. These rumors claim he was forced to leave after an egregious misuse of power. If this is true it may add legitimacy to our claim.{^n}{^n}In the meantime I am taking steps to gather opposition against the blatant political ambitions of the Marcell house and plan to contact each of the high houses of Crown Hill individually, seeking their support. Yours is the first I have reached out to as our families have proven to be staunch allies in the political sea of our fine city.{^n}{^n}I am well prepared to take any and all action against Marcell and the families of those buffoons he's appointed to the council and I hope you will stand by me when that day comes.{^n}{^n}With Regards,{^n}{^n}-Fredric Greystone

tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA12Name=Letter to Theodin Marcell
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA12Text=I understand full well what your proposal was and I agreed to all terms, but I had no idea you intended to enact your plans so rapidly.{^n}{^n}The dissolution of the sitting council and the appointment of new members of your own choosing is a bold move but it has put myself, as well as the other houses who agreed to join in your arrangement, at grave risk of being defamed. Just this morning, I received a missive from house Greystone wherein Fredric Greystone threatened to report you to the High Council of Erulan and asked for my support in his "refutation" of your "illegitimate claim to power". For now, I have no choice but to go along with his little coup so as to defend the reputation of House Marion.{^n}{^n}Greystone also had a number of interesting accusations about your time in the capital. I would very much like to discuss them in person.{^n}{^n}Additionally, our operations in the Candle District have encountered steep opposition. The meager roaches which infest the streets feel that they can make demands of Crown Hill and are threatening rebellion if they are not met.{^n}{^n}While I have no doubt that you will honor your part of our little arrangement, I pray for the sake of both our great houses that you have a solution to deal with the ever expanding problem that is the growing mass of wretches who consider the Candle District home.{^n}{^n}Respectfully,{^n}{^n}-Ronald Marion

tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA13Name=Council Report to Theodin Marcell
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA13codexTitle=Council Report
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA13Text=I am pleased to report that, despite initial delays, our efforts in Port Valbury have paid off and the full measure of our plan is coming to fruition. Reports from High Advisor Van Aldritch indicate that the collection of specimens is now running without interference and they will be packaged and prepared for your personal needs posthaste. It seems our investment in that vessel was well placed, as you believed it would.{^n}{^n}Our remaining challenge is moving the specimens through the harbor. I have diverted the deliveries to the Blackiron docks, where closer scrutiny of cargo is less probable due to the frequent military shipments, and the overbearing schedule we've imposed upon the dock workers is keeping them too busy to ask questions.{^n}{^n}Despite that, we currently have surprisingly little oversight there. However, Vernath of the Port Authority has proven to be a pleasantly simple target. He is a petty and insecure man, traits that make for easy pickings. Through him, we have ordered the harbormasters to issue weekly reports highlighting unusual activity or unexpected arrivals. This allows us to monitor harbor activity more closely and silence any unfortunate leaks of our plans before we are ready to execute the Glorious Dawn. Swiftly dealing with accidents will sow fear and distrust among the dock workers, ensuring that further incidents are avoided.{^n}{^n}Additionally, work on the great houses of Crown Hill has been proceeding rapidly. As has been quite common among these humans, the wealthy people of this city are conceited, disloyal and power hungry. They fight, even amongst their own families, with but the slightest provocation. The council shall continue to encourage such infighting until such a time as we have gained sufficient influence among the city's elite and selected the most susceptible vessels.{^n}{^n}Respectfully,{^n}{^n}Councilman In Residence{^n}{^n}Alberran Rein

#MalmouthAetherialFactory_01
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA14Name=A New Consensus
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA14Text=Our recent setbacks in Homestead and beyond shall not be taken lightly. However, I believe we may bend this unfortunate situation in our favor. We must not wither at the hapless prodding of such feckless creatures. While the humans are blindly focused upon the machinations of the Dead God's children, we must take this opportunity to realign our priorities. At the recommendation of Overlord Van Aldritch, I decree a change to a recent consensus.{^n}{^n}It is then a consensus that the Shaper of Flesh be recalled to Malmouth immediately and allowed to finish his latest work without further interruptions. Progress on the Fleshworks has stalled in his absence, a grave miscalculation.{^n}{^n}Marcell will be returned to his ruling seat in Malmouth where his focus will once again be upon concluding the growth of the factory, with him at its heart. This project must not be allowed to suffer any further delays. A shortage of specimens will thusly not be tolerated.{^n}{^n}All nearby regions are to double collections and begin rerouting all shipments to Malmouth immediately.{^n}{^n}-Adjunct Orin Vostra, Fourth of the Circle of Five

#MalmouthAetherialFactory_02
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA15Name=Birthing Success
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA15Text=I am pleased to report that our recent experimentations upon human female specimens have been exceptionally successful.{^n}{^n}It appears the hosts are far more receptive of our impregnation methods than previously thought. Additionally, younger, more fit specimens have shown incredibly rapid rates of development and recovery. Their bodies are more durable and longer lasting allowing us to increase the rate and frequency of impregnation, with astonishing results. These specimens have proven capable of hosting two or more incipient ovules per womb. We have reduced the required gestation period by half and, due to the longevity of the younger hosts, we believe we may be able to further accelerate the process.{^n}{^n}I have full confidence that we can make further improvements, so long as we maintain a steady supply of specimens. However, with the population rapidly dwindling in Malmouth, it may be time to draw upon our reserves of living subjects from Erulan and beyond.

tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA16Name=Missive to the Master of Flesh
tagGDX1LoreObj_AreaF_NoteA16Text=First, I must apologize for my tone in our earlier exchange. Your recent experimentations in Malmouth had the Circle concerned that you were diverging from the established consensus. We now see that we have erred in our judgment.{^n}{^n}The Circle finds the results of your experimentation upon living tissue to be of the highest interest. If the findings are indeed as promising as you assert, then a new consensus shall be ordained without delay; one that takes these new parameters into consideration in our grand vision.{^n}{^n}Which brings us to the other matter which has spurred this communication. The Circle has been made aware of stirrings within the Aether that may prove concerning. Great eyes now turn their attention towards this world. If They are made aware of what has transpired here, then all we have created, all we gained, may be in jeopardy. Our grand vision must not be interrupted by cosmic ruminations.{^n}{^n}Victory is at hand, but we have to claim it! It is prudent that you execute your role without fail and I trust that we shall experience no further complications, Shaper of Flesh. No further delays shall be tolerated. We can no longer afford to be patient.{^n}{^n}-Adjunct Orin Vostra, Fourth of the Circle of Five

I shall now make it my tireless task to ensure that our operations in Malmouth proceed as planned and within the necessary time constraints.{^n}{^n}This vessel will prove ideal in the city's downfall. He was educated in the capital at the behest of his wealthy family, family with powerful connections among Malmouth's elite. He lacks all pretense of society or compassion, devoid of empathy for his fellow man. All he craved was knowledge, knowledge that others would shun or find sickening. To encourage such crude pursuits was only natural and now he is mine.{^n}{^n}With the guise of Theodin Marcell, I shall carve into the city's elite and exploit the corrupted heart that beats within. How does one shatter a city? By allowing the rot festering within its fragile existence to flourish. And by my hand, it shall grow magnificent indeed.{^n}{^n}-Theodin Marcell, Surgeon

We have reason to believe that his recent actions have diverged from the consensus and now threaten our grand vision.{^n}{^n}If what we suspect is true, then you are to proceed immediately in returning the Shaper to Erulan and taking his place as the heart of the operations in Malmouth. If however we have erred in our suspicions, then report on this miscalculation immediately and ensure that the consensus proceeds as ordained.{^n}{^n}With Their eye falling upon us, we must be swift in our actions.
