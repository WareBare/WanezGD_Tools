tagQuestItem_Dravis_A01Name=Dravis' Letter to Daila - First Entry
tagQuestItem_Dravis_A01Text=Dearest sister,{^n}I am confident that this letter will find its way to you. You cannot resist returning to this place; I know that the memories of that night still conjure nightmares in your sleep. The face you saw, that is the price one pays for learning the truth. Truth which you deny!{^n}{^n}Do you remember how we used to play around the old ruins as children? Father always told us not to, that we would be swept away by the harpies that fill the sky in the twilight hours. But what if he was not just trying to protect us? Perhaps there were ulterior motives to keeping us away from the old places of the world? What if, should we venture inside, we would learn more about his past than he wished for us to know?{^n}{^n}I have done what you could not, Daila. I have defied our father and entered the depths of Anguish. It is there that my eyes were truly opened. If you are wise, you will do as I have...{^n}{^n}Dravis

tagQuestItem_Dravis_A02Name=Dravis' Letter to Daila - Second Entry
tagQuestItem_Dravis_A02Text=Daila,{^n}by now you must have seen the haunting echoes from Arkovia's past. Have you never wondered how all this came to be? How Arkovia really fell? Father called it greed, but greed alone cannot condemn a man to such torment. Nay, powerful sorcery was at play here.{^n}{^n}I could feel it in the very walls. The stones screamed with unfettered rage, rage towards...me. Do the dead despise the living so? Do they yearn after what was stolen from them? To exist in such a state of endless limbo would drive any soul mad, but I do not believe that madness is what inspired this response. There was something familiar within these stones.{^n}{^n}I have to learn more. So I intend to visit the one place I know our father had been: our childhood home. Of course, this presents me with a bit of a challenge, as you well know why, for our home was consumed by the Chthonian rifts not long ago. But such trivialities will not stop me from discovering the answers I seek...{^n}{^n}Dravis

tagQuestItem_Dravis_A03Name=Dravis' Letter to Daila - Third Entry
tagQuestItem_Dravis_A03Text=Daila,{^n}The pieces are finally falling into place. The answers were under our very noses all along. The rift violently consumed our home, but in doing so it revealed what was hidden from us underneath the floorboards. Our father kept a journal, a seemingly innocuous object, yet the pages were sealed from me with a protective rune.{^n}{^n}Carelessly, or perhaps arrogantly, I dispelled the seal. The resulting flames consumed the book and marked my face with embers that refuse to extinguish. It is agonizing, but I will endure. Despite our father's efforts, I was able to rescue some pages from the inferno. He told us that our mother died in childbirth, that much is true, but what you do not know is that we were not the first. There were other women, and other children, but the dates...they did not make any sense. It was not until I turned to the final page that the answer became clear.{^n}{^n}I must make haste to the City of the Dead. Therein lies our final clue...{^n}{^n}Dravis

tagLoreObj_AreaDDravis_NoteA04Name=Dravis' Letter to Daila - Final Entry
tagLoreObj_AreaDDravis_NoteA04codexTitle=Dravis' Letter to Daila
tagLoreObj_AreaDDravis_NoteA04Text=Daila,{^n}I shake in anticipation of what is to come, I can hardly write these words with a stable hand. Our father, our legacy, it is more than I could have ever asked for, more than I could have even imagined. To deny us this heritage...it is a crime against his very children. But I have learned his secrets and I will not be denied.{^n}{^n}Our father is immortal, Daila. It has taken him a thousand-thousand souls trapped within a single moment of agony to accomplish this impossible deed. What dark day in history served in the pursuit of immortality, I cannot say. But here, in the Necropolis, our father prepared a different ritual. This one was meant to harvest what remained of the tormented dead within the grave site, to replenish his own shattered being, but for whatever reason he never finished it. The sigil was abandoned. All that remained was to light the pyre and offer a living sacrifice.{^n}{^n}Without hesitation, I finished what he could not. Though I am not truly immortal as he is, the power within these souls will be enough for me to track him down and repay him for all the suffering he has instilled upon us. Then, when my vengeance is complete, I shall use the calamity that now consumes the world to do as our father had before, all those centuries ago.{^n}{^n}Should you reconsider in joining me, Daila, seek me out to the East. I shall be standing triumphantly over our father's ashes.{^n}{^n}Dravis

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA01codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 1st Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA01Text=I am currently en route to the village of Burrwitch in order to investigate a number of strange incidents that have been reported in this area. As dusk is drawing near and the swamps of this region are said to be hazardous to travel at night, I've reluctantly taken up lodging at a small squalid tavern in Lower Crossing.{^n}{^n}Perhaps I am weary from my hurried travels but I feel as if there is a strange pressure and electricity to the air. It is almost akin to the still before a thunderous summer gale but yet the sun shines and not a cloud is to be seen.  Everything seems as it should, but in my gut I feel that something terrible will soon come to pass...

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 2nd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 2nd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA02Text=As I was packing to resume my journey to Burrwitch, my assistance was urgently requested at a logging camp in the Old Grove west of Devil's Crossing, where strange animal attacks have left three lumbermen listless and pale.{^n}{^n}Upon arriving, I received a somber greeting from the foreman who informed me that the bitten workers had gone mad and fled the premises. They were reported to have spoken in an unknown tongue.  The foreman showed me the remains of the animals. Two gray foxes and a hound, suffering some sort of horrific mange, lay in a hastily dug pit behind the outhouse. The foreman told me the animals suddenly died when confronted by the workers and a strange green vapor emanated from their remains. Shortly afterwards, the three lumbermen fell ill and their mental state rapidly deteriorated. It appears that my presence in this region is most warranted.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 3rd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 3rd Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA03Text=I've finally arrived in Burrwitch after passing through the dismal area known as Wightmire. For years, tales of supernatural occurrences have circulated about Wightmire and indeed the name itself makes one uneasy. I hadn't put much stock in them but my recent experiences lend some credence to the old tales.{^n}{^n}Nevertheless, I have reached my destination and it seems the Warden of Devil's Crossing, who resides in Burrwitch, somehow anticipated my arrival. A footman greeted me as soon as I entered town and insisted I accept Krieg's invitation to be put up at his manor. I find this very peculiar but I have accepted the offer as it may be my best chance to investigate the manor itself.{^n}{^n}Going to make this entry short as I've just been summoned to join Krieg for supper in the dining hall. This should prove...  illuminating.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 4th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 4th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA04Text=I've been a guest to Warden Krieg at his manor for over a week now and my suspicions that something terrible is going on here grow with each day. Every day, I set out to some destination in or around Burrwitch to investigate yet another unusual crime or ominous rumor. Some are easily dismissed as more mundane human crimes or merely fantastic tales, but many of my investigations have come to darker conclusions. I feel there is a pattern emerging here but I cannot yet put the pieces together.{^n}{^n}These are peripheral cases though and the main purpose of my involvement in them is to give pretense for my prolonged stay in Burrwitch. Krieg himself has become the focus of my primary investigation. Despite an overwhelming conviction that Krieg is not what he appears to be and is almost certainly involved in some sort of unnatural activity, I have found no irrefutable evidence of wrongdoing that could be used to open an official inquisition.{^n}{^n}Much of the manor itself is closed off to me. There are rooms upstairs from which Krieg and other visitors come and go but I am not permitted to enter. Stranger yet, I've awoken in the night to sounds like the creaking of wagons moving along a road but then looked out my window down upon the village and seen nothing. Where are these sounds coming from? The game of cat and mouse continues but, as of yet, I am not certain who is the cat and who is the mouse...

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 5th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 5th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA05Text=Krieg has gotten the better of me and I am presently at his mercy, imprisoned beneath his manor.{^n}{^n}Seeing no other way to progress in my investigation, I forced my way into the locked portion of the manor and found myself in a veritable house of horrors. The unusual sorcery on the locks should have been my first clue that I was dealing with something more extraordinary than some rogue occultist.{^n}{^n}My search led me through a room filled with the rotting bodies of men and women subjected to brutal torture or horrible experimentation, or perhaps some mix of the two. Behind the manor I found a door leading down into the earth beneath the estate, where I found myself quickly lost in an implausibly large dungeon. It wasn't long before I sensed things moving in the darkness all around me and they quickly closed in, surrounding me. As I prepared to fight for all I was worth, Krieg's massive form emerged from the shadows, his face expressionless. He spoke coolly as though nothing at all was out of the ordinary and invited me to tour his facility. While I had no doubt that something unpleasant was planned for me, it at least delayed my confrontation with the living horrors gathering in the dark.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 6th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 6th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA06Text=I've lingered in this dank cell for one long unsettling day and a night of terrors. Krieg allowed me to witness the process by which they are preserving human bodies for what he calls the Glorious Dawn.{^n}{^n}I have gotten glimmerings of another consciousness within Krieg, which is joined with or possibly in control of him. From the way he spoke, it is clear that this is only some small part of a much greater conspiracy and I suspect many other persons in key positions have been possessed by things akin to that which now inhabits Krieg. I was arrogant in my initial handling of Krieg and seriously misjudged the power and scale of the threat we are faced with.{^n}{^n}Fortunately, Krieg's own arrogance has likewise led him to misjudge the resourcefulness of his prisoner. He has invited me to ascend beyond humanity by pledging myself to his cause or to join his inventory of embalmed corpses. I've been left to contemplate this decision but this cell, even magically warded, cannot hold the likes of me and I have no intention of being here when Krieg returns for my answer.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 7th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 7th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA07Text=Much time has passed since my last entry. Following my escape from Krieg's laboratory, I have raced against time and lost, passed through darkness and flame, and witnessed the ruin of the world as I knew it.{^n}{^n}Even as I assumed key figures in the capital were likely to be possessed by the entities we now call Aetherials, I reasoned that it was only with support from within capital that we could hope to thwart them. Any action that began outside the capital could be spun as a political rebellion and crushed with the empire's own forces before the truth could be exposed. Thus, I cast the dice and raced toward the heart of Erulan, trying to conceal myself as best I could.{^n}{^n}Upon my arrival, I proceeded cautiously, booking a room at a squalid inn near the west gates in an effort to keep my arrival secret. Initially I sought out old acquaintances, assuming if I could detect some change in personality or behavior, it might reveal possession. A few awkward reunions made it painfully obvious that years on the road carrying out my duties as an inquisitor had left me out of touch and unable to discern whether any changes were the result of possession, or just the passage of time and faded memories. The only gamble left then was to report back to the citadel of the Luminari and see what came of it. I never made it there.{^n}{^n}Waiting until the sunlight dwindled and crowds thinned in the streets below, I rose to leave but was quite startled to see that a shadowy figure had somehow silently breached my room, evading all of the wards set against intruders. This is how I came into cooperation with the First Blade.

tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08Name=Journal of Inquisitor Creed - 8th Entry 
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08codexTitle=Inquisitor Creed - 8th Entry
tagLoreObj_InquisitorCreedA08Text=It was known that anyone of significance who fomented discontent or posed a real threat to the rule of the emperor might be visited by the First Blade. I had never stirred such controversy but I always imagined, if such an encounter took place, I could put up a respectable fight. I never got the chance. Taken unawares, I was disarmed before I even knew what was happening. Had he sought my death, I would not have even witnessed the killing stroke fall. However, he seemed more interested in answers instead and, in turn, provided me with an account of his own events that confirmed my worst fears.{^n}{^n}The First Blade revealed that, only days prior, he had been forced to turn his knives on the Emperor himself, by his own command. Despite the myriad safeguards protecting the Emperor, both mundane and arcane, he had become host to an Aetherial. Through strength of mind, he had usurped his possessor long enough to summon the First Blade, command his own execution and charge the assassin with ensuring that his son, the young prince, survive to reclaim the throne.{^n}{^n}His last commands issued, the Emperor's consciousness slipped once again under the control of the Aetherial and a desperate battle ensued. The First Blade reported that he believed the Emperor and the Aetherial within him slain but, given his inexperience with the entities, could not say anything for certain. He relayed that he had secretly taken the prince and put him into hiding but declined to elaborate. The First Blade said he intended to retire his imperial title and had chosen the name Ulgrim, which made me curious as to whether it was an intentional reference to the mythic character.{^n}{^n}A final troubling detail was that no proclamation of the Emperor's passing had been issued. Not only did this demonstrate the Aetherials had sufficient control of the palace to conceal the death but, given that they couldn't hope to hide the Emperor's absence for long, it suggested the next phase of their operation was imminent.{^n}{^n}I strategized with Ulgrim long into the night, formulating a plan to counter the Aetherials, but ultimately we agreed that we could not defeat their conspiracy in time. The only course left was gather whatever people and resources we could, go to ground and weather the coming storm; then find a way to counter the invaders.{^n}{^n}We agreed that the Black Legion would be our best hope in securing allies. As a conscripted army of criminals, debtors and political dissidents bound to service, it seemed unlikely that the Aetherials would have any reason to infiltrate them when they could control them indirectly through the military high command. The next step was to discretely make contact.

tagLoreObject_PrisonNoteText=Now, I ain't a decent man and I sure ain't good at writing, but word needs to get out 'bout what this place really is. This prison, it ain't like no joint I ever been in, and I've seen double my share. Men don't stay here long neither and some of the lads they haul in, they ain't criminals. I'd know. Moment I see a man, I can tell by his eyes that he done wrong. These boys? I see fear.{^n}{^n}I seen this warden a coupla times, big man in black armor. If you ain't know better, you'd think he was on the wrong side of the bars. Every day, he and his lackeys take prisoners out to this hut in the yard by the dozen. They ain't never come out. Later, a wagon rolls in by the hut. It always leaves full.{^n}{^n}They don't let us outa our cells no more, but I can tell there ain't much of us left. The halls are quiet. I'm the last man in my row. The others? They was taken in yesterday's batch. I ain't asking for pity. I know my end's in that hut; but perhaps this note will be my one good deed in my pathetic life...

tagLoreObj_LowerCrossingA01Text=Autumn fogs are appearing early this year but traffic remains unusually high.  There is a steady flow of small craft coming down from Malmouth and other townships to the Nor'East. Some of these boats are barely afloat burdened with what looks like people's every possession. These travelers, sometimes entire families, bring with them strange tales of wars and the unnatural. Bunch'a hogwash riling up the soft townsfolk. Can't complain tho', keeps the dock busy. Most are Westbound, trying to get as far away as they can.{^n}{^n}The lads at the docks are starting to lose their nerve. Some have talked about setting out West themselves but I've assured them this is all nonsense and will pass. Youth are easily caught up in the energy of the moment.

tagLoreObj_BurrwitchB01Text=Another boat arrived filled with hooded prisoners, dozens of 'em. As usual, a wagon was waiting for them but from what I hear, it doesn't take 'em far. One of the loading boys came back from Burrwitch after visiting that there new doctor and he said the wagon stopped outside the Warden's mansion. The lad asked 'bout the prisoners and one of the handlers said "rehabilitation". Not sure what to make of that.{^n}{^n}There's been o'er a dozen of these prisoner transports in as many weeks. I just don't see how they can fit 'em all in that mansion. I don't care how big that place may be, Krieg won't be keeping a prison's worth of no good thieves under his roof. Somethin' peculiar is going on there and it don't settle right in my stomach. Might have to send word up the lake to Malmouth, get one of them inquisitors down here to look into this curiosity. Can't say I want one o'them inquisitors poking around here much either though. They make a man uneasy.

I've never regretted our life together but now only regret that I lost my temper and spoke unkind words when last we parted.{^n}{^n}I hope you will not think me a coward for what I am about to do.

However, before that can happen, we must first secure Wightmire so that there are no enemies at our backs.{^n}{^n}Though strong, loyal and ready to die in the name of Ch'thon, I believe you have insufficient Bloodbound to overcome the Aetherial presence. We have had great success recently in bringing forth more powerful servants of Ch'thon from the Void. A single Harbinger could wipe out all of the Aetherials in Wightmire and even take on Devil's Crossing, which could serve as a stronghold for our order in this region.{^n}{^n}To bring forth a Harbinger, you will need the blood and lives of at least three men. Gather the sacrifices however you see fit; either from refugees on the road, rover camps or chosen amongst your own Bloodbound. Inform me of your success when it is complete.{^n}{^n}Ulto Treig, Grand Priest

tagLoreObj_WightmireA02Text=I'm afraid I may have to break a promise. I'm not about to give up yet but things aren't looking good outside. I was lucky to survive that first night when I volunteered to distract the rotten walkers while Bourbon and his group, including my little sister Sybil, made their way through to Devil's Crossing. I believe in Bourbon and if anyone can get those people through, it's him. Before they left, I looked Bourbon in the eye and told him to keep her safe. He put his arm on my shoulder and spoke in that calm reassuring tone of his. He told me that he would do everything he can, but I had to promise him something too: that I would do my damn best to get out of this alive.{^n}{^n}Well I've sure got myself into a fine fix. I diverted them walkers alright but now I'm all hemmed in. I've been hiding in a group of old dilapidated shacks and keep changing position whenever the dead get too close. I can't find a way forward though and I'm running out of daylight. The walkers seem stupid generally but I think they dug out the riverbanks last night, allowing the water to wash the road out. It's almost as though something is directing them.{^n}{^n}I'm not done yet and have no intention of dying in this rotting shack. I'm going to try to break free and will go out fighting if I have to. If the worst comes to pass and you're finding this note on my cold corpse, well, please let my sister Sybil know what's come to pass and tell her to be brave. I can only hope she made it to Devil's Crossing.

We can't eat coal though, and our food supplies are starting to run out. The Rovers barely had a few scraps between them.{^n}{^n}With the Burrwitch bridge destroyed, we're stuck in this swamp. I'm beginning to wonder if perhaps we made a mistake by not following Cronley's Gang to the west. May not be much pickings in the wilderness on that side of Devil's Crossing, but at least they had numbers. Could probably hunt down a decent-sized boar between the lot of them. Out here? We got nothing but slith and the dead.

We've progressed to the point where the corpses can endure for months, possibly years, with minimal, mostly external, deterioration. Our Aetherial overseer seemed satisfied and he, or it, unexpectedly placed his hand upon one of the corpses and released a spark of aetherial energy. The thing began to move as if it were alive again. It was a ghastly sight.{^n}{^n}What I found far more troubling though is that these corpses are clearly not meant to serve as Aetherial hosts.

TagLoreObj_OldArkovia_History01Text=As I write this, dark columns of smoke billow up from the port where the madness long pullulating in the restive populace has finally boiled over. A blazing merchant's galley, abandoned by its crew and freed of its moorings plows into a group of fishing boats, wood splintering, the fire quickly spreading among the sails. I hear shouting in the courtyard below and the clash of iron not far beyond; a woman screams repeatedly, her words indiscernible.{^n}{^n}For so long, we feared our doom would come from the barbarous mountain tribes but in the end, we've been the instruments of our own demise; helped along by the insidious promises of the necromancers.{^n}{^n}It is not yet two moons since the great rituals were undertaken, led by our ever reaching Oligarchs; the rituals intended to bring immortality and ensure the lasting greatness of Arkovia. Ever the skeptic, I figured it for a sham; political theatre at best, but the ritual seems to have been a tragic success.{^n}{^n}This ritual was the invention of a necromancer named Uroboruuk. A man imprisoned in the Steps of Torment, who it is said did not age and could not be killed by any means. The leaders of the three greatest houses, including my own patron, Laudos Vagra, made an ill-conceived journey to the tower in hopes of compelling this Uroboruuk to give up his secrets. Here, immortality worked against Uroboruuk as he was subjected to the most brutal and imaginative forms of torture that could be devised for a man who could not die. Finally, Uroboruuk agreed to instruct them in the ritual and the Oligarchs, blinded by their lust for immortality, were all too eager to believe his will broken and accepted the ritual as genuine.{^n}{^n}It has become clear that the people of Arkovia have indeed gained a form of immortality but it is a cruel and twisted fulfillment of that promise. Our bodies still suffer the ravages of time, eventually dying and decaying, whilst our spirits remain trapped within, eternally bound to this land.{^n}{^n}I have witnessed this myself as the sick and elderly, near death at the time of the ritual, remain with us yet. Their bodies visibly decay, in the manner of a corpse, yet they continue on as though living, able to move and talk; still much the same persons as they were in life, yet not.{^n}{^n}All who suffer this death of the body become somehow less vital, less dynamic of thought. They become ever more narrowly focused on whatever concerned them most in life. It is disturbing to witness families that do not know what to do with their deceased, yet still present, loved ones.{^n}{^n}More horrible still are the rumors of babies born since the ritual. Abominations they say, deformed and bearing dark grisly feathers. It is said that many forlorn new fathers have been seen trekking into the broken hills, bundle in arm, to leave their unnatural offspring to the elements.{^n}{^n}The din of fighting and wailing continues on below. I expect it shall for quite some time since the combatants cannot die by any mortal means. I will sit with my books and continue my writing for whatever time may remain... perhaps all eternity...{^n}{^n}Theodokus Vagra, Scribe of Arkovia

tagLoreObj_BookC01Text=To understand the flows of the Aether, one must first learn to appreciate its inherent risks. The arcane art is not a plaything, nor is it a tool meant to be abused. Countless young arcanists have lost their lives to carelessness and malpractice. Proper control of the Aether requires years of practice under the careful supervision of the Gildam Arcanum, the only formal office sanctioned to instruct and research the art of the arcane. Do not confuse what is lectured here with the teachings of the hypothetical witch gods, a common misconception amongst the uneducated. There are no gods. There is only reality and the science of the arcane.

Part man, part serpent, the Slith were a testament to the dangers of the arcane and served as the driving force behind the formation of the Gildam Arcanum and its tighter sanctions on arcane practices.{^n}{^n}The Slith owe their existence to the actions of a single individual: Oswald Hargate. Backed by family wealth and a passion for research, Oswald aspired to leave his mark upon the study of the arcane. Little did he know that his legacy would leave a permanent stain upon all Arcanists and their field.

Convinced that he could supersede the gods, Oswald set out to perform his heinous research in a, to this day, unknown location.{^n}{^n}Though not much is known about the exact details of his research, the results were quite clear. Calling his creation a Slith, for its slithering movement and snake-like lower body, Oswald triumphantly announced his findings to the Arcanum Society. The abomination bore the torso of a man and the tail of a snake, though its reptilian snout was unlike either species. Its eyes stared back at you with a hint of human sorrow, though it was clearly a dulled mind with no indication of a human conscience trapped within the slith body.{^n}{^n}Those attending were shocked by the blatant disregard for the gods and their domain. Following a brief trial, Oswald was charged with endangering society and was imprisoned for the remainder of his life. The specimen was destroyed and its ashes scattered to the winds. With Oswald behind bars and the slith dead, all believed that the nightmare was over; but they were wrong.

tagLoreObj_BookD03Text=When the first slith began to appear in the area known as Wightmire, it became clear that Oswald did not create just one slith. As his laboratory was never uncovered, officials could only guess as to the origin of the new species. The slith were incredibly invasive, easily dominating the local food chain and reproducing at an alarming rate.{^n}{^n}As their numbers multiplied, the slith adapted a primitive tribal hierarchy, with certain members of their packs exhibiting clear authority over the rest. And, perhaps most alarmingly of all, shamanistic behavior was reported among the slith population, indicating a strong connection to the Aether and perhaps their unnatural origins.{^n}{^n}All efforts to exterminate the slith proved fruitless, with the species simply returning at a new location from hidden nests and caverns. It is without a doubt that the actions of one arrogant individual will continue to reverberate across countless generations to come.

Its short lifespan and rapidly shedding skin made for a malleable test subject. The initial results seemed promising at first. Using high concentrations of Aether energy, we were able to instill various mutations within the specimens, creating new limbs or inducing gigantism. Unfortunately, none of the samples survived beyond a couple weeks, their higher brain functions being seemingly incapable of handling the introduction of additional bodily elements.{^n}{^n}For our second batch of experiments, we molded the adders with a few grobles captured by local trappers. The results were...curious to say the least. While this was not the breakthrough I was looking for, we seem to be heading in the right direction. The dull mind of a groble was capable of adapting to its new body, but its primitive and disgustingly malformed physique would see me become the laughing stock of my colleagues. No, I must see this through to its logical conclusion. Helen may frown upon it, but the next step seems clear as day to me...

They are but simpletons, unable to fathom the importance of my work.{^n}{^n}The specimens began stirring by morning, their frightened cries echoing throughout the lab. I explained to them that they were selected for an important duty, that their lives would finally have meaning and purpose. The scum should have been thanking me, but instead they cursed me as a madman and criminal. I dismissed their accusations and got to work. There was much to be done.

While Ellena was otherwise occupied with her toys in the living quarters, Helen came down into the lab to find me in the midst of my latest study. The horrified look on her face is something I shall never forget. I tried to be reasonable. I explained that what she witnessed was merely a stepping stone, that those men and women died so that our work would not be squandered on snakes and grobles. But she would not budge.{^n}{^n}My wife, my partner, had betrayed me at this most critical junction. My work is too important to let emotional attachments get in the way. I did the only sensible thing. Let history judge my actions...{^n}{^n} With the unfortunate distraction dealt with, I returned to my results. The human-snake hybrids had proven unstable and violent. I was assaulted on several occasions while attempting to study their physical functions, but those attacks proved to be little more than outbursts on the verge of death. All of the specimens died shortly after the procedure. Dissection revealed an incomplete hybridization of internal organs. With a dysfunctional digestive system, death was inevitable. But I wonder if perhaps the subjects were too old for the procedure to succeed. If I started over, with a younger candidate, then perhaps I would finally have the results I seek...

tagLoreObj_OldArkovia_NoteA01Text=I thought about ending it. But I witnessed first-hand what happens when you try. Good people, driven to madness by this...this curse... I don't blame them for trying to escape this never-ending torment, even if escape seemingly comes at the edge of a knife. There is no way out though. We are bound to our flesh and bone, even as they rot away to the winds of time.{^n}{^n}To others, a knife brings a sharp reminder that we once lived. There are those who willingly partake of this newfound pleasure, carving each other apart in a downward spiral of decadence and depravity. But I cannot deny the temptation to join those in the streets as they spill their blood onto the cold stone. As I look upon my rotting hands, I begin to wonder if perhaps it is too late even for that. How long will this torture last? How far will we decay before we are at last set free?

tagLoreObj_OldArkovia_NoteB01Text=This is to be a record of the passing of the final verdict regarding the practice of necromancy and its prominence in Arkovian society.{^n}{^n}The grand court has reviewed the case of one Olurokk who had willfully and consciously committed the despicable act of raising the deceased form of his neighbor's wife and using her to torture and exploit the victim for personal pleasure and financial gain. Under the weight of undeniable evidence and witness reports, this court had no choice but to sentence the necromancer Olurokk to hanging until dead.{^n}{^n}This crime is but a drop in the well of the sins committed by necromancers in our land. The people have spoken and action must be taken. For this, and countless other crimes, against nature, against the gods and against Arkovia, let it be known that the practice of necromancy, the most vile of the ancient arts, is henceforth forbidden from the lands of Arkovia under the strictest of punishments. Those found ignorant of this proclamation shall be transported, without trial, to the Steps of Torment, where they shall be locked away to the last of their days in the deepest pits of Anguish.

It is only in man's nature to fear what he does not understand and our art is no different. Necromancy was never held in high regard in Arkovian society, but it is only in recent years that we have been treated with such growing animosity.{^n}{^n}Now with the recent formal decree from the high court we are not just outcasts, we are criminals. What they fail to understand is that the only crime committed that day was against the pursuit of knowledge and the advancement of our people. Already they are rounding up my brethren under the guise of justice and taking them deep into their den of torture they call the Steps of Torment. I suppose it is only a matter of time before they come knocking on my door.

I dreaded opening that door but there she was, covered in tears, a small bundle in her arms.{^n}{^n}She begged me to help, that the gods had turned away from her in her greatest time of need. With a shaking hand I uncovered the bundle to reveal the motionless face of her infant child. It was dead for no more than a day at most.

What wonders, and horrors, have these stones seen? The splendor of a shining kingdom and the corruption that brought it all crashing down, all told within a few bits of rock. All of it is lost now. Only fragments remain in the old tombs and the forgotten places. I often wonder if King Rhowan was deceived, that by abdicating his throne he brought about the very thing he wished to flee?{^n}{^n}I also wonder how many of those last lords of Arkovia fled to this once great fortress to escape the collapse of their empire? The great Arkovian Watch, guarding the southern borders. Did they hide in futile hope of being overlooked by the rampaging peasants who sought them out for their greed and arrogance? Or did they fight to the last? Were they captured and hung from the walls of their own strongholds? Or did they flee into the catacombs only to perish among the relics of the past?{^n}{^n}I sit here now and wonder what my fate will be among the ashes of the past. Will I join them, equally forgotten? Or will the bandits and horrors now stalking the world find me in this hiding place and tear me apart? Not sure it matters anymore.

That world is gone, lost to time as the great Arkovian Empire.{^n}{^n}We have been reduced to savages, fighting for scraps of food and blankets like packs of wild dogs. We murder one another for a place to sleep and sacrifice our friends and family to blood cults in vain promises of safety.

Just the other day, we lost three on the west wall when a bunch of them corpsefiends burst out of the bodies and took everyone by surprise. They was bleeding us dry, with no end in sight to their numbers. Hell, pretty sure I've seen a few of our dead lurking around out there. Now I ain't no general, but seems to me like it was only a matter of time.{^n}{^n}The boss says that we've won, that Old Arkovia belongs to the gang.

That unsettling green glow reminds me of the dead ones.{^n}{^n}Or maybe I'm just agitated because the crystals Cronley stuck in my back seem to vibrate whenever the duo's around; like they're ready to rip loose.

tagLoreObj_Cronley_NoteA04Name=Excerpt from the Annals of Arkovia
tagLoreObj_Cronley_NoteA04codexTitle=Annals of Arkovia
tagLoreObj_Cronley_NoteA04Text=It falls upon strange times that a king would abdicate the throne of his own volition. Stranger still is the reason he gave his court. There is no other way to put it. King Rhowan, the third of his line, had been struck by madness. Upon returning from a successful campaign against the barbarian tribes of Agarond's Peak, the King raved about a chance meeting with a weary traveler whom he called Mogdrogen. Rhowan, in his generosity, offered the old man the use of his horse. The man, and here is where the King's tale loses all sense, declined the proposal and, speaking in a low voice that only his Majesty could hear, instead offered Rhowan a warning.{^n}{^n}The old man spurted prophetic lies about the impending collapse of our great nation and the fall of the beacon of the west, Arkovia herself. He implored the King to leave his title, his wealth, his very identity behind. There were some amongst the court who urged Rhowan to see his madness through, greedy heads of Arkovian Houses who saw this tragedy as an opportunity to seize power. The Queen, the shining jewel of Arkovia, wept before her King and begged him to reconsider; but Rhowan was resolute. With a single decree, he shattered the royal line and abandoned his ordained post as King of Arkovia. Word of the King's madness spread quickly among the populace. To my great surprise, some of his subjects followed Rhowan's lead, abandoning their livelihoods to follow their despondent ruler into a life of poverty and lost identity.{^n}{^n}It has been three fortnights since that fateful day. The queen lies dead in her chambers. They say she had died of sorrow, from the loss of her King, but I suspect more clandestine causes. The court has fallen into chaos as the great Houses bicker amongst themselves for the empty throne. With no end in sight to the squabbles and no clear line to the throne, my patron, Laudos Vagra, has called for the formation of an Oligarchy, ruled by the heads of Arkovia's elite.{^n}{^n}No good can come of this. Of that I am certain. These days, I cannot help but wonder if Rhowan's prophecy was a self-fulfilling one. Or perhaps this storm was a longtime coming and we were merely too blind to see it. I fear for Arkovia. I fear for her soul.{^n}{^n}Theodokus Vagra, Scribe of Arkovia

All they had to do was squeeze and any other man would have sung them a tune worthy of the Erulan opera; but they've never contended with Darius Cronley. They came, two of them, humans in robes. Only thing that'd give them away was the eyes. The eyes glowed that sickly aether-green. They offered me a chance to surrender, a chance to live out our lives as vessels and breeders for their growing army. I sent their heads back on spikes. See if those spirits survive that.{^n}{^n}But when they came back again, with new terms, well...then they were speaking my language. I was to be a piece in their grand design, a master of my very own army of aether-empowered humans.

I've been left to my own devices, but for one caveat: eradicate Devil's Crossing. It is a task I will relish with great pleasure.  There are so many ways I could squeeze the life out of Bourbon, but unfortunately I'll have to settle for just one. Perhaps after I behead his mangled corpse, I'll shove him full of aether shards and bring him back as a personal servant. Then I can kill him over and over and over again.{^n}{^n}But first I must finish my glorious army. Another batch of aspiring followers is due to arrive within the hour. They have no idea of what suffering and agony is in store for them. I sometimes wish that more would die during the procedure.

Let the land, which has blessed our family with harvest for generations, continue to provide for you and your children. And now to my bullheaded sons, Edric and Anthony, you have filled my remaining years with your endless bickering over whom would inherit my fortune. To you, I leave nothing but these words.{^n}{^n}I had the farmhands bury the gold somewhere on the Everbrook lands.

I turn around to see the eyes once more, staring back at me. I hear laughter, a child's laughter. Then everything is fire. I try to scream, but nothing comes out. The eyes just stare ahead as I writhe in the flames.{^n}{^n}That is when I awaken, drenched in sweat. It has been like this for five nights in a row.

So I've been writing at night, when he's asleep. He cannot stop the muse that pulls the strings of my heart.{^n}{^n}The Weeping Oak, by Daila Thornsbury{^n}{^n}The limbs of a nearby tree tapped a steady rhythm against the bedroom window. Another storm was building up on the horizon, but Daila could not shake the feeling that this would not be just another shower. She sat up in her bed and took a quick glance at her husband, Oliver. He was still fast asleep. Not even a hurricane would stir that man from his slumber.{^n}{^n}Daila got up, making sure not to shift the covers off her husband. She tip-toed to the wardrobe and retrieved her gear: a well-worn suit of light leather armor and her trusty sword, Stormheart. The blade sparked with electricity as she removed it from its scabbard. The enchantment was still as strong as the day she had found it in the tomb north of Darkvale. Daila replaced the blade and hooked the scabbard into her belt. She took one last glance at Oliver before heading out the door. It was best he did not know about her little nightly vigils. He would just worry himself sick, and Daila could not stand to see him so obsessed over her safety.{^n}{^n}The wind whipped Daila's hair around her face as she stepped out the front door. The rain was already starting to pick up; the ground was drenched with moisture, turning the path into mud. Daila tread carefully, planting every step on a stone or where the ground was still firm. At last she arrived at the edge of the lone oak tree, a place she could be alone with her thoughts, but there was something off about the spot that night. A deep sense of dread immediately overcame her.{^n}{^n}"I knew you'd come out to greet me, Daila my dear," a ghastly voice spoke from behind the tree. Daila drew Stormheart, its sparking surface turning the rain drops into mist. A dark figure showed itself and calmly walked towards her. She could not see the man's face, but she knew well who he was. "Come now, is that any way to greet your brother?" The man spoke again. Daila did not say a word. Instead, she let her blade do the talking for her. The figure countered her blows with a blade of his own, a burning sword that left streaks of fire across the air with every swing. "I see you've been practicing," the man said with a grin forming on his lips.{^n}{^n}Thunder crackled in the sky as lightning flared down from the heavens, briefly illuminating the scene. The light from the storm revealed the face of Daila's adversary, the grisly heavily decayed face of her brother. "Dravis," Daila hissed through clenched teeth. She dove in for another attack...

I set off to the foothills and made my way through the warren of low stone walls, fences, and occasional farmhouses. I was careful to move in secret and remain undetected from the horrors that still roam the fields unchecked. I made it to the valley of two hills near the river when I witnessed something I can barely comprehend. {^n}{^n}An unearthly black pillar that was neither stone nor flesh drifting slowly across the land as would a low cloud.  A sickly green glow burned at its core and great writhing tendrils hung from somewhere underneath the shifting back shell. I watched in mounting dread as the unholy obelisk slowed and then, without warning, burrowed the hooks of the dangling tentacles into the ground. The ground began to wither and glow with the same unwholesome green. It was then that the obelisk pulled itself into the ground. With a sound that made me feel as if the earth was dying, it began glowing so bright I could hardly look. Its power seeped into the ground, twisting and corrupting as it spread. {^n}{^n}I lingered for nearly an hour in that place and in that time a great distance around the obelisk had been changed. I was about to leave when the obelisk erupted from the ground and drifted to an untouched patch of land to begin the cycle again.

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA04Name=Blood for Ch'thon
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA04Text=I try to console them. I tell them everything will be alright. Their eyes go wide with fear as I find the spot between the ribs and push the blade in. They always cry and it makes me a little sad. They do not yet understand. I watch the blood as it flows down their naked legs and into the large basin I have placed below their suspended form. Ch'thon calls for every drop.{^n}{^n}To ensure I get it all, I begin by making shallow cuts. First the legs. Then the torso. And lastly the arms. Slowly their struggle rescinds and they accept their fate. At last they find understanding.{^n}{^n}The blood is not theirs. They are only holding it for another. And now it must be returned. To Ch'thon, to whom it rightly belongs. At last their fear is peeled away and they are happy to give the blood freely.{^n}{^n}Devoted Servant of Ch'Thon, Bellor Heind

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA05Name=The Call of Blood
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultist_NoteA05Text=My whole life I have reveled in the spilling of blood. For years I have been driven to hunt in the shadows. Lurking and hunting alone. But I am alone no longer. At long last I have found what has called to me.{^n}{^n}Ch'thon has whispered to me and the Grim Dawn has released my shackles. Now I take my pleasure and collect the blood for my Lord. It fills my heart and warms my soul to watch the last drops of blood flow.{^n}{^n}The old world was not understanding of my need. But now a new power has risen and Ch'thon has called on me. And those who do answer the Call will be my prey.

tagLoreObj_AreaCCultistSummoner_NoteName=Final Sermon: The End of Times
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultistSummoner_CodexTitle=The End of Times
tagLoreObj_AreaCCultistSummoner_NoteText=Bloodsworn supplicants of Ch'thon, it is with great purpose that we gather here today for what will be my final sermon to you. You have devoted yourselves completely, forsaking all past relations, earthly possessions and free will. You have proven that you are finally ready to become part of a greater whole, to receive the glorious gift of reunification.{^n}{^n}I must remain behind with the others to finish our great work, yet, even as you depart your lives, you will advance this broken world one step closer to the end time. The time when the dismal, suffering world will become reunited with Ch'thon, making the oldest of the old whole again and righting the great wrong perpetrated millennia ago by the false gods! These upstart gods who manipulated the course of our existence, set themselves up to be the objects of worship and have lived off our blood and toil for ages.{^n}{^n}The end time will also bring doom to the wayward Aetherials, past agents of the false gods who were betrayed and then cast into the formless aether once their purpose had been served. They have hindered us, slaughtered our brethren and tried to claim dominance over this world. Yet, we must also thank them, for it is the Aetherials who have unwittingly made possible our ascension by destroying the empire and its inquisition. No longer does the inquisition hunt us, suppress our truths or deny us access to our sacred places. Unshackled from the strictures of the empire, people have awakened from the false dream of civilization and our ranks have swelled.{^n}{^n}Not knowing the history of our world, the Aetherials are ignorant of the doom that we will awaken. They cannot surmise our end game and once they realize what they have set in motion, it will be too late for them to stop us! Our most devoted brethren march with legions of the void for Necropolis. They need only prevent our enemies from breaching our final line for even as they attack our forces, the blood they spill will feed our resurrection ritual. Where once we suffered our greatest defeat, our ultimate triumph shall be reborn and the Loghorrean, forerunner of the end time, will carry the thousand screaming voices of Ch'thon into the world and usher in a new age!

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note01Name=Laruka's Journal
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note01Text=Today marks a critical moment in my life as one of Uroboruuk's pupils. Having passed the trials, the only thing that stands between me and the coveted title of necromancer is performing a reanimation.{^n}{^n}I've had the pleasure of seeing our master at work countless times. He is truly a master of the craft, requiring neither reagent nor word to bring the dead back into the living. Uroboruuk claims that this is a matter of practice and form, but I am convinced otherwise. His grasp over death supersedes us all, even his oldest students who, at a whim, may call upon spirits to do their bidding; but even they require binding runes and focusing stones of which our master makes no use of. The dead Uroboruuk brings back don't just serve him; they seem eager to please their master, as if to earn his favor.{^n}{^n}But now it is my turn to join the elite ranks of the Order. I've studied the scrolls, learned the rites and burned the words into my memory through exhaustive repetition. I've gathered the grave moss and the dust from buried bones. I am ready. Tomorrow, I will drag a soul back from beyond the veil of death and force it into skeletal remains. Tomorrow I emerge from the sepulcher as a full-fledged necromancer.

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note02Name=Order Doctrine
tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note02Text=The Order of Death's Vigil was founded upon the principles of Uroboruuk, our immortal grandmaster. Uroboruuk taught us to never be fulfilled by life's countless mysteries, to reach ever deeper into the fount of knowledge.{^n}{^n}As members of the Order, it is our sacred duty to preserve and maintain knowledge, regardless of its origins or unsettling nature; as it is not for man to discern its value. Knowledge is a wealth easily squandered by those who fear it, as evidenced by the near eradication of our Order's founding doctrine, the art of necromancy.{^n}{^n}Mastery of the ultimate fate which awaits all men represents an unparalleled frontier of learning. So it falls upon our neophytes to conquer their fear of death, to accept its harsh lessons. For not even in death does duty end.

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note03Text=Something powerful is coming from beyond. I have sensed its approach for some time now. But like a dream or some distant memory, the details were lost to me... until now.{^n}{^n}I can feel it clawing its way through the veil somewhere to the northeast of Burrwitch, no doubt drawn here by the maelstrom of otherworldly corruption. I dare say, its nature eludes even me; but it is neither flesh nor spirit. I must discover what it is we are facing and, should the need arise, seal it away again behind the barrier between worlds.{^n}{^n}The Order need not concern itself with these matters quite yet. I must do this alone...{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk

tagLoreObj_AreaCNecro_Note04Text=I will rip the bones from a thousand for this treachery. At a great cost I have survived a deadly attack.{^n}{^n}I had discovered a large contingent of Chthonic fiends. At first, I thought they were the source of power that I sought and so I trailed them. As they travelled North, I soon realized that they too were after the same thing as I. They made their way to the cliffs by way of the swamp. In following them, I had walked right into an ambush as I was suddenly attacked from behind.{^n}{^n}The fight was devastating and I destroyed dozens in the ensuing conflict. However, in the midst of battle, several of the Harbingers cornered my Guardian. I first believed they intended to destroy it; but when they exploded, a rush of Chthonic energy surged into my creation and severed our link. The animated mass of bone turned on me, and I knew then that the Harbingers had found a way to corrupt my necromantic creation. I do not yet understand how they were capable of such an act, but it was unlike anything I have ever seen Chthonic beings do.{^n}{^n}If the fiends of the Void are able to harness this power on a larger scale, then even the Order of Death's Vigil will find itself outmatched. I must maintain hope that what I seek will be an answer to fighting this darkness. With each step the power grows and others will be drawn to it. I must hurry.{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note01Name=Acolyte's Pledge
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note01Text=When the world ended, I did not know how I would survive. It was only by the grace of Kymon that they found me. Buried in the mud and rubble of my house, it was Father Kymon who knew where to find me. It was his hands that pulled me free of certain death.{^n}{^n}Now that I am here, I pledge to do everything I can to fight this evil and to serve the cause that gave me a second chance. It is by the will of Kymon that I now carry his light to the world and save who I can. Praise be to the Blessed Father.{^n}{^n}Acolyte of the Chosen, Carth Lavine

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note02Text=I have seen first-hand the cleansing power of the flame of Kymon and will never falter in my belief. Our forces outnumbered by horrors beyond comprehension, it was then that I first laid eyes upon him.{^n}{^n}Like a shining beacon in the chaos, Father Kymon charged into battle. He was as a flaming wind scorching a forest left to grow wild for too long, cutting down the twisted and reviled roots that seek to strangle this world of light. I knew that day that he will be the one to lead us from this horror. It is his righteousness that burns through the darkness of this world and banishes the evil. I will not fail him.{^n}{^n}Blade Maiden Sendra Ambri

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note03Text=The Messenger is harsh to deal with. With each exchange I feel drained as though my life were being drawn into a deep well. Everything appears darker and farther away as if seen through a long tunnel. A lesser man without the years of Inquisitor mental training would be consumed.{^n}{^n}Even as I write this, I can sense its energy rippling through the room. I can feel it like worms twitching below my skin. It burrows and pulls, urging me to get closer. I dread to think of what would become of any of my Chosen should they get too close to this entity. What would remain, I cannot say, but I suspect the Messenger would shuck the mind and claim the body for its own.{^n}{^n}I fear there are none who would understand or survive this secret. I alone must shoulder this burden and so I will steel myself and endure. I have taken on a great risk, but the fate of the world hinges on the success of The Chosen and the pact that I have made.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon

tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note04Name=Kymon's Journal - Page 2
tagLoreObj_AreaCZealot_Note04Text=There are questions that have been scratching at the back of my mind. I have tried to push them aside but with each conversation I have with the Messenger they become harder to ignore.{^n}{^n}I must ask: when the last demon is driven from this world, what will become of us then? In my heart, I fear I already know the answer, but dare not speak it out loud. I have no doubt that I have made the right choice. The power I have revived will be humanity's salvation from the blood fiends of the Chthonic Void.{^n}{^n}However, there must always be evil. And when there is no evil left to conquer who or, more frighteningly, what will fill that emptiness? Will we become as reviled as those who we oppose? The Primordial powers have no care or sympathy for humanity. Without shackles, this power I have borrowed could be just as disastrous as, or perhaps even worse than, Ch'thon.{^n}{^n}I now wish I had not burned the town where I awoke this ancient being. If it ever needs to be stopped I may have destroyed the last remaining knowledge to unmake it.{^n}{^n}Father Kymon

tagLoreObj_AreaCTryant_NoteA02Text=This makes no sense. I have been ordered to dismiss my army without pay. Furthermore they have given the men their weapons and armor as final payment. What are they thinking?{^n}{^n}This order can only result in anarchy. Half these men will become bandits or worse. If dismissed without pay, they won't have a second thought about turning their blade against the Empire. Without this garrison, the grobles will reclaim this area unchallenged. The road from Darkvale to Devil's Crossing will become impassable.{^n}{^n}We have been holding this fort since the fall of the Dranghoul savages, but they keep pressing to take it back. I have requested more men and weapons from Erulan and this is the response I get in return? Madness! I have half a mind to ignore this decree, and if my wife and son were here with me, I would.{^n}{^n}Upon further reflection, these men might also turn against me. Not that I feel I have mistreated them, but they could easily view me as part of the aristocracy that has put them in this predicament. I must leave before they receive this news or I fear I will never see my family again.{^n}{^n}Duke Cavanil, Commander of Fort Tyrant

tagLoreObj_AreaCTyrant_NoteA03Text=The fools. Curse the Empire soldiers for abandoning their post at Tyrant's Hold. What devilry has compelled them to such a thing? Do they want to see travelers killed and devoured by savages and beasts? I pay the Empire very high taxes to keep the roads safe. If they are not going to do their part, then I will simply stop doing mine.{^n}{^n}When I return to the Merchants Guild, I will be filing a formal complaint against the Empire and the Army. If I can generate enough support, then we can boycott the major cities and put some real pressure on the diplomats in Erulan. Maybe even force them to pay restitution to the Guild. They may be royalty, but even they will bend to the power of coin. It would make me very happy indeed to see the all mighty Empire bowing to the Guild for a change.{^n}{^n}And now more wonderful news. A traveler heading North said they were robbed by bandits to the south. What's worse is many of these criminals were dressed in soldier uniforms. Is it possible the regiment from Tyrant's Hold has gone rogue? I think it's high time we did away with this decrepit system of rule. It's treason to even think such thoughts, much less write them down, but if we survive this it will be long past time for dramatic change.{^n}{^n}Pavel Ludnum

tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA01Text=For weeks I have been getting the feeling that something bad is coming. Like a knot in the pit of my stomach that won't go away, and each day it gets a bit worse. I have also noticed a lot more travellers from the capital of Erulan. Heading south with all their worldly possessions. I asked a few for news from the north, but nobody could give me a clear answer; just an unshakeable feeling that something awful was about to happen. How is it that we all share the same dread?{^n}{^n}No shipment from the capital again. Last week we didn't get our latest deliveries, and now again? No shipment coming in means no shipment going out. How am I supposed to run a store if I don't have supplies to sell? Local goods are fine but I rely on being able to sell things people can't get straight from their neighbours.{^n}{^n}I am hearing hushed conversations in the streets and a customer told me she saw some cloaked figures rolling a barrel down to the lake. And now the town drunk is missing. More likely than not he finally tripped and tumbled over the ravine. But still, there is a strange chill in the air and everyone seems to be on edge. I'm starting to think that packing up shop and heading south may be the best thing to do.{^n}{^n}-Trevor Mills

tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA02Name=Mayor Bridgewater's Journal
tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA02Text=I'm not one to wish ill on anyone for their beliefs, but I can't say I like this new faith spreading around town of late.  With all the frightening rumours coming from the north, religious fanatics stirring up the populace is the last thing we need. Heath Strighbow says this religion of Ch'thon is not new, but in fact very old. Well, if it's been around for so long how come I have never heard of it? One of their preachers invited me to sit in and listen on their sermons, to dispel any ill feelings I have towards the matter. They seemed innocuous enough, but the obsession with blood and rejoining with their god in the end of days left me uneasy.{^n}{^n}Another person has gone missing. Last week it was Thom, who I admit was a drunk and a nuisance to the town, but this week it was Mary Tess, the town seamstress. Zaria told me that she saw Mary leaving town with a group of refugees, just as Trevor did a few days prior. At least Trevor stopped by my place to say he was leaving, but Mary, she didn't say goodbye or take anything with her.  It's all just very strange.{^n}{^n}As I write this I am preparing to meet with the town leaders to work on a way to handle all of the travellers passing through the Darkvale Gate.  Hundreds come through every day now.  Thankfully most don't stop, but if this keeps up we will have a real problem on our hands. I don't know what is going on in the capital, but it has everyone concerned.{^n}{^n}-Gregor Bridgewater, Mayor of Darkvale

tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA03Name=Peacekeeper Chambre's Journal
tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA03Text=Our little town is surrounded by forts and soldiers of the Imperium, and yet I have never felt more alone or vulnerable. Each day I see more and more soldiers leaving Fort Haron to head north while the road through Darkvale is a never-ending stream of refugees heading south. Those fleeing the capital tell horrific tales of people gone crazy, of robbing and looting as madness consumes the head of our nation. One story even described a mob running down a woman in the street and devouring her alive. Sounds like a horror story, but I am assured that it's the whole truth.{^n}{^n}With so many new faces in town, my deputies are taxed with holding the town together. Fighting over scarce goods has become a daily ritual. We have had several murders in the last two weeks, a concept once entirely strange to our little village. Three more people have vanished over the last week. At first we didn't pay it much heed, what with the coming and going of folk on account of the refugee situation, but with these three it now makes a total of six that have gone missing since Thom with not a soul aware of where they'd gone to.{^n}{^n}Whatever is stirring in the capital must be making its way here as well. Some unseen dread that you can't quite pinpoint, but you can see it in the faces of those travelling south. Desperation... fear... it's all around us now, and it has taken root in Darkvale. The mayor has expressed similar concerns, particularly around a strange new religion that's been attracting followers recently. Could they be behind the recent disappearances?{^n}{^n}-Vincent Chambre, Peacekeeper of Darkvale

tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA04Text=Everything is proceeding as the Bloodlord had intended. My year-long employment as the town's Apothecary has earned me the people's trust and I am now in the perfect position to spread our cause. And for those who refuse to listen to reason, who refuse to embrace the truth that is Ch'thon, my position as healer has made it an easy thing to take life without arousing suspicion. A little bit of powder from the Asterkarn Nightshade root mixed in with a prescription will put anyone to sleep for hours.{^n}{^n}After that, it is a simple matter of retrieving the dissenter and perform the required observances. With each person we return to Ch'thon, I carve His sigil in their flesh. For me it is the most important step in the early stage of the draining ritual. The blood drains quickly from a slit across the carotid artery and drains into the specially prepared oak casks that the carpenter, another blessed by the Bloodlord with this task, prepares for me. Not as nice as the glass vessels we have been preparing, but much easier to hide suspicion. The body is stored in a second barrel, weighed down with stones, and then sunk to the bottom of the lake. Nearly every death over the last year has added to our tribute with no suspicion falling upon us.{^n}{^n}But now, with the servants of the false gods arriving at the capital and spreading havoc across the empire, our time has finally arrived to reveal ourselves from the shadows and usher humanity into the end times. All shall receive the gift of reunification!{^n}{^n}-Zaria, Apothecary of Darkvale

I have already dispatched my loyal Bloodsworn to barricade the Darkvale Gates, trapping the refugees inside. They will all fuel the ritual in due time.{^n}{^n}Once news of this reaches the Black Legion, we will have to be prepared for a counter assault. I will personally see to converting the frightened and misguided who remain in Darkvale. If they will not join our cause, then they can dance at the end of a rope and be drained as encouragement to those who have yet to choose.{^n}{^n}They must all learn that there is no place safer than under the guidance of the Bloodlord.

tagLoreObj_AreaCDarvale_NoteA06Text=The process of collecting blood was so slow it was driving me crazy, so I set up a two-tank system, then rigged the Public Bathhouse plumbing with a drain switch. Now we can drain the water from the tubs back into the water tank. But when I flip the switch, the drain will go into the second tank, where the blood can then be stored. However, the pulley system with hooks was the crowning accomplishment. It hides out of sight when not in use, but when we are ready for sacrifices...{^n}{^n}Zaria has provided me with Nightshade root to dissolve with the bath salts. Combined with the hot water it should lull our guests to sleep. Then we drain the water, perform the rites, flip the switch and collect the offerings without spilling a single drop. It took some effort, but I am proud of what I have set up. It is the first step to mass collections and will speed up the process.

This language probably hasn't been spoken aloud in over a thousand years. What long forgotten god was once worshipped here? And why do we know nothing about it? The hideous carvings depict a gruesome scene. Was it a wicked god? It can't be Empyrion.{^n}{^n}The Three were never depicted in such a way, and besides, the witch gods were not known to embrace such open displays of devotion. They preferred the secret places, hidden from sight and the light of day where their followers could practice without the fear of the Luminari discovering their covens.{^n}{^n}I was under the impression that the Imperium had stamped out all the heretics in their last bloody crusade across Erulan, over a century ago. The inquisitors were quite thorough given the catastrophic death tolls recorded. Surely nobody had survived to invoke whatever power was trapped within these stones?{^n}{^n}And yet the monolith is warm to the touch and the torches are lit as if someone visited regularly. The carving hums with strange power that sends a chill down my back. Perhaps it is best that this place be left alone, lest I stir whatever lies dormant within the ancient depths.{^n}{^n}Nezmitt Osteram, First Scribe of the Silver Tower



#AreaD Notes

tagLoreObj_AreaDSecret_NoteA01Name=A Terrible Discovery
tagLoreObj_AreaDSecret_NoteA01Text=The Earthquake has inflicted some damage on the upper levels of the catacombs. Bones scattered, tombs crumbled, piles of rubble everywhere and one of the bridges was completely destroyed. This is terrible news as it forces us to take long forgotten alternate paths to reach the furthest end of the catacombs. My true dread is in exploring the deepest foundations. I am no stranger to death. I have combed over battlefields and waded through blood and gore to recover the brave heroes lost in combat. However, this secret place where the bones of cursed and nameless damned are banished makes my skin crawl and my soul scream. With every step I wish to turn and flee from this unholy place.{^n}{^n}I have long proposed that keeping the remains of so many wicked men in one location is unwise, but thus far my voiced concerns have been dismissed. Criminals, witches, heretics, cursed, murderers and the insane have been secreted away down here. I can feel their malignant souls heavy upon the air drowning us in their combined guilt; pushing the crumbling walls until they buckle; calling to the dark hollows of the earth; imploring vile things to seek this prison and release the centuries of evil that is trapped within.{^n}{^n}I have discovered a great tear that has opened up beneath the catacombs. Several support walls have collapsed and fallen into the darkness below. There are scratches on the floor and walls as if something scored the very stone. I have also found bones with strange markings on them, as if gnawed by an animal. And lately I've been hearing sounds coming from the walls, as if something was skulking in the darkness nearby. Some wretched thing gliding along the shadows staying just outside the light. My worst fears have come to pass. I must flee and warn the others.{^n}{^n}Caretaker of the Dead, Aleister Pencroft

tagLoreObj_AreaDCatacomb_NoteA01Name=Loose Ends
tagLoreObj_AreaDCatacomb_NoteA01Text=Deceived. Stuck down here in the dark like a rat in a trap. I write these words so I might have vengeance. It's unlikely that this will be found but, if someone reads this, know that Malvek Brevele is a traitorous cur.{^n}{^n}I am Nazahn Untraze. I am a foreigner to these lands, and unashamed to say that I am both a thief and assassin. I tell you this now so you know that I am truthful in my later words. I have been in the secret employ of a wealthy noble, one Malvek Brevele. Most of my work for him was stealing key pieces of information and material for leverage. I have slit the throats of no less than three of his rivals or their agents. I broke into the chambers of the man above Malvek and placed certain evidence. This resulted in the man's arrest allowing Malvek to move into his position of power. None of this is new. Same things happen with wealthy men and scheming nobility the world over.{^n}{^n}More recently, he bade me to recover an ancestral artifact from his father's tomb. The family Signet Ring. A thing that should not have been buried he says. But the argument between father and son led to rash decisions. I care not for the reason, his coin was always good, but I say nothing and let him speak. He went on to say "The tomb is lavished in my family's vast wealth of the ages. Touch nothing. I am not paying you to plunder my ancestor's tomb. You are only to recover my father's signet ring and return. And make sure you carry a torch. Seldom a light escapes those depths. Do not dare return without the Signet".{^n}{^n}I found the entrance easy enough but it just revealed stairs into blackness. After lighting a torch, I descended into the tomb and wandered these halls for hours, searching for a single name amongst these countless thousands of dead. At last I gave up. But I would not leave empty handed. I was driven to find the wealth Malvek spoke of. I went farther and farther into the darkness. There were some treasures, but nothing of what he hinted at. I pressed on, ignorant of the risk of losing my way back.{^n}{^n}Once the torch started flickering I knew, as if I had planned the betrayal myself. Malvek had played me like a fool. His careful choice of words stung at my pride and ensured that I would be driven to find the Signet despite any risks. And the subtle suggestion to bring a single torch, I was a fool to bring just the one.{^n}{^n}Here I am to stay as I write these final words. Now I see the deception for what it was. Only the elimination of a loose end. My light is done, and so am I.{^n}{^n}Nazahn

I have requisitioned slaves, building materials and the rune sealed crates to be shipped to the excavation site. I personally oversaw the transport of each of the deliveries and must inform you of one unfortunate incident.{^n}{^n}A wagon lost a wheel and one of the crates was damaged causing a seal to be broken. This resulted in a leak. The driver insisted on helping and, despite my best attempts to dissuade him from touching the contents, he got some of the leaking ichor on him. I dispatched the poor fool on the spot, a merciful end compared to what that vile fluid would have done to him. I have contained the damage and seen restitutions paid to the man's family. Besides this unfortunate incident, there were no further delays. The remains are safely stored at the bottom of the Necropolis awaiting the completion of the prison.{^n}{^n}I have presented your documentation to the old Architect in charge of the construction and, while he protested, he did not stand in the way of the Imperial writ. However, in the few months since I have been here, he has insisted upon reviewing what it is that we are doing to "his great work" as he keeps calling it. I have expressed the lack of wisdom and safety of this course, but he persists. Hemal Listari has a family, which might be a source of leverage to force him to leave well enough alone. Unfortunately, I fear his curiosity may force us to take drastic measures before this project is finished.{^n}{^n}Vestiaris, Imperial Arcanist

The entrance to the chamber is now solid rock and buzzes with an unearthly hum as if a swarm of wasps were inside.{^n}{^n}We have been sealed in this horrible place with nothing but these rune-covered crates. There is a putrid moisture to them that bites at the back of your nostrils. I can't stare at the writing on them for too long. They burn the eyes and blur the vision. I don't think we should open them, but the others are starting to get hungry and hoping there is food inside. I know there isn't any. Every muscle in my body is telling me to get as far from those crates as possible. The runes marking them are the same as those we were ordered to carve into the walls of this chamber.{^n}{^n}I believe this is a prison of some kind, built to hold whatever is slowly oozing out of those containers; and now we are trapped in here with it. I may have been on the losing side of the war, had to watch many of my comrades die on the battlefield. But this? This is no way for a man to die.

It's sad to leave our home but I am hopeful for a better life far away from the dangers that seem to be ever increasing here in the north.{^n}{^n}Day 4: Silvie is so happy, running along the side of the wagon picking flowers. I was really worried about her being unhappy as we left behind the only home she has ever known. The wonder and splendor that is youth. It warms my heart.{^n}{^n}Day 6: The mountains are looming ahead of us and the cold is getting sharp. I can see the worry in John's face as he tries to keep up his spirits. I know he only wants to protect us from the dangers and I can only pray that we make it past the mountain before the snow.{^n}{^n}Day 8: We are in the shadow of the mountain now and the days are shorter. Snow has started to fall and the cold came on so suddenly it surprised us. We have warm clothes but the wind cuts right through them.{^n}{^n}Day 11: We have reached a flat at the base of a fort. There are a few other travelers here who have told us the way through to Darkvale is blocked. With our food running low, we were hoping to resupply at the Darkvale Gate Merchant District. Now I don't know what we will do. Turning back is not an option with the snow coming down so fast. John says he is going to talk to the others soon.{^n}{^n}Day 16: The horse died today. John is saddened by this but at least it will feed us until help arrives. I hate that we had to make this trip with Silvie. She is only nine and I don't like the way the other men at the camp look at her.{^n}{^n}Day 22: All of our horse meat is gone. It would have lasted longer if we didn't have to share it with the others. But John said things could have gone badly if we did not. I don't like thinking about what he meant by that.

They took it without another word and left us alone. Does friendship mean so little in these times?{^n}{^n}Day 36: John offered Silvie to one of the men in the camp. When the man came into the tent to make his advance, John killed him in front of Silvie and me. I am so hungry I don't even care.{^n}{^n}Day ??: It's so hard to write. Numb fingers and the cold dulls my thoughts. The dark of the mountain makes it easy to lose track of the days.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Another man has been lured to our tent.

They lie to themselves even as they walk into the butcher's blade.{^n}{^n}Day ??: Our next visitor was wise to the attack. John killed him but not without suffering a terrible wound.

tagLoreObj_AreaDNecropolis_NoteA01Text=I have been commissioned to construct a grand mausoleum that will house the thousands of dead from the great battle with the west. This will be my Magnum Opus. The project will take many decades and at my age it is unlikely that I will live to see its completion.{^n}{^n}I have begun drafting the plans in my head. The main tomb will be centered around a vast well, which will house most of the fallen. The quantity of earth we will need to move is staggering, but it will serve as a foundation for the rest of the city of the dead. While this is being done, a small army of civil servants will be carefully collecting the bodies, crafting notices of identification, and preparing them for temporary burial. It will be many years before the fallen receive their proper burial.{^n}{^n}We have started construction of temporary mass grave structures to hold them. Some of the families have insisted that they take the remains to which I have no objection but I cannot imagine why they would not want their loved ones to be honored here, at the site of their glorious victory. I should note that the bodies of the enemy will be shipped back to their border and left for them to do with as they please. I mean no disrespect to their fallen but, quite frankly, they are not our problem.{^n}{^n}There are thousands of workers being commissioned for the digging, hauling and carving of the stone. Where Erulan found so many able-bodied and willing workers so quickly is obvious. Slaves. Brought from the imperial prison mines, or enemy soldiers from the war.  Distasteful, but there is too much work to get done to be timid about this.{^n}{^n}So many things to consider and prepare. I am eager to get started. I can only hope that my wife and son will be happy here.

I don't care how much the Imperium is paying me. I will not stand for it.{^n}{^n}Over the last seven months, I have written several distasteful letters to the Erulan council stating my displeasure with these arrangements. Not a single response. Every time I see that wretched man, Vestiaris, I confront him on the subject; and every time he gives me the same tired response: "I have been appointed by the Erulan Imperium. If you take issue with my duties here, please take it up with them". Well they can ignore me all they want. This is my vision and I will not be pushed aside as it is befouled.

When I asked what we should be looking for, he almost lost his temper and said "Anything that might cause a disturbance". His reaction seemed rather out of place and strange. The commander is not known for such outbursts. It also struck me odd the way he used the word "disturbance".{^n}{^n}I took my scouting squad through the north gate and almost immediately started seeing some Aetherial activity.  We changed our course and headed for the hills rather than traveling the main road. It took longer but we avoided large numbers of the Aetherial dead. They appear to be gathering in the north in preparation for an attack. Their numbers have swelled tremendously since my last mission outside the walls. The return trip is going to prove difficult. I sent one of my scouts back to report this information immediately.{^n}{^n}Heading north we passed by the Necropolis. From the mountain top we did not see anything unusual. Searching as far as we could on our resources we discovered nothing but the accursed blood cultists everywhere.  Avoiding them made our progress slow. We did see one strange thing of note: the cultists appear to be collecting blood in vast quantities and hauling them in wagons filled with large glass cisterns. We followed for a bit to see where they were being taken, but were spotted and forced to retreat.{^n}{^n}1st Regimental Scouts of Black Legion, Sergeant Matius Castalan

That is assuming we survive.{^n}{^n}-Captain Frederick Bachknell{^n}{^n}Report 1: Report from the North Wall Night-Watch: While patrolling the upper wall I witnessed a soldier enter the armory. I would not make note of it except that he appeared to have been looking around the courtyard to make sure none could see him as he entered the gated door. The torches were out in that area of the courtyard so it's impossible for me to say who it was.{^n}{^n}Report 2: Report from the Officer of the Watch: Several men have gone missing and we suspect that they have deserted. A complete search of the Fort and surrounding areas has ended with no sign of them however. The scouts have found no sign of tracks and have concluded the men never left the Fort.{^n}{^n}Report 3: Report from the Master of Arms: I have discovered ten small casks and five large casks of blackpowder missing. It is difficult to account for the missing supplies since only five people in the entire fort have access to the keys that would open the blackpowder storage. Commander Lucius headed the search himself after receiving the worrying report, starting from the bottom levels all the way to the top of the towers. Nothing was found.

tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA03Text=This is my final report on the massive explosion that has destroyed the north courtyard. It is intended to be read with the compiled notes pulled together from the past week.{^n}{^n}With the intent of establishing a damage report and the death toll, I assembled a squad of soldiers and led them into the shattered depths below Fort Ikon. The explosion appears to have blown down into the sewers making the smell in the armory ungodly. That, in and of itself, has made it almost impossible to go down there. The plumes of smoke reduced our vision and choked the air. Crumbling walls, supports and floors were in constant danger of additional collapse. The explosion appears to have been centered on a single large support below the armory. At the bottom of the devastation we found several dead men, charred almost beyond recognition. They appear to be the men who went missing earlier this week.{^n}{^n}My investigation indicates that the missing men were using the stolen blackpowder to make an opening into the sewers to make their escape. In closing of this report, I'd like to raise two concerns. The first is: one of the men was an explosives expert and should have been aware of the destructive potential of so much powder. By itself, I wouldn't give this detail a second thought, if not for my second concern: another of the men has been with the Black Legion for nearly eight years with no signs of dissent or disagreement with command. In fact, he was due for promotion to a commanding position soon. Something doesn't fit here. The tale that is painted indicates sabotage from within, but who would go to such lengths to frame these men? Without more information, I cannot say with certainty what is going on, but my gut tells me that there is more at play here than at first appears.{^n}{^n}Captain Frederick Bachknell

tagLoreObj_AreaDIkon_NoteA04Text=I have successfully infiltrated the fort, as you commanded. It is ironic that the commander of this garrison is one of the weakest minds I have ever encountered. There is so much turmoil and fear that resides within him, he was easy to manipulate and overwhelm. While I do have full control of his body, there is something in the region that tampers with direct communication, something tainted and ancient. Anything capable of such an act demands further investigation. I write this correspondence in the meantime, so that another may look into this matter.{^n}{^n}Fort Ikon has proven to be a challenge for us, and now I understand why. The vast stores of weapons and warmachines the humans have amassed is staggering. It is a wonder that they have not exterminated themselves in their endless pursuit of warfare and self-destruction. Nevertheless, everything moves according to our grand plans. I have already taken steps to sabotage their armory and planted evidence leading to several deserters. Nobody suspects my involvement.{^n}{^n}But the main reason I have deemed it necessary to report to you comes from a most unexpected discovery. The anomaly, the revealer of secrets, walks among these humans and even now shares with them our plans. We have since adjusted our projections in this region, ensuring that anything the anomaly reveals is of no use to the humans, but its knowledge of our ways could still prove detrimental to our success on this world. For now, I have begun sowing the seeds of distrust about the anomaly to the humans, their fear is so great that they had it moved to the prison, where it remains. Once my sabotage is complete and the gates are open, Fort Ikon will fall. Then we can deal with the traitor as is fitting of such unprecedented betrayal.

Blood that belongs to those who I have killed in its name.{^n}{^n}The blood-soaked foundation of this forgotten battleground has peeled away the fear and awoken me. There is no forgiving what I have done, no punishment that will ever make it right. But I can give my last breath, my last drop of blood and at last my life to cause as much damage as I can.

My position is not that important to the empire to warrant such aggression. Nor am I that despised by any of the factions within the city, not to my knowledge.{^n}{^n}No, this doesn't feel politically driven. It's as if it were a personal vendetta. With the identities of the assassins pointing in several disparate directions, it is difficult to paint the full picture. I need more information. My advisors now insist that I have four guards with me at all times. What a bother.{^n}{^n}Advisor Aldritch has suggested that, until we know more about the nature of my attackers, I should avoid all public hearings, to minimize risk.

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA03Text=I have had the same recurring dream several nights now. There are some slight variations but the context remains the same.{^n}{^n}Every time, I find myself walking through the looming alleyways of old town. I don't know who I am, but I can feel fine silk slide over my skin as I walk. The ancient and pitted cobblestones under my feet send shards of broken stone flying with each hurried step. An unwholesome fog rolls in from the festering dumping grounds that have begun to spill over the retaining walls and into the main road. For some reason this pleases me.{^n}{^n}I seem to be aware of details and affairs that I should not know. For example, I know that the fog is not natural. It gathers here by the will of an unseen power pulling the strings. In my dreams, this power is familiar to me, almost welcoming, but as soon as I am free of the dream, the meaning is lost upon my waking mind.{^n}{^n}I make haste through the concealing fog towards the Harbormaster's offices. There I find myself in a poorly lit room with two figures obscured by shadows, both men. One is large and loud. He smells of rotting fish and stale beer. The other is also large, but more in physical stature than the girth of his belt. He clinks and scrapes with the sound of metal as he moves. A soldier or town guard perhaps.{^n}{^n}They talk but I cannot make out what they say. The sense of dread and malice that pours from these men is a palpable wave of fire. In my heart I know that the decisions made around that table will mark the end of the world for mankind.{^n}{^n}But last night's dream was different; it kept going. I find myself with a bird's eye view of the city, watching as arcane fire spreads across the horizon. It grows as far as the eye can see and burns all it touches to ash and oblivion. Then, as if floating at the end of a rope, in one hard pull I find myself back in the dark room. The pungent odor of unwashed men and rotting ocean fills my nose. I stare into a cracked mirror hanging on the wall, but I do not see myself staring back. It is the face of the High Advisor, his expression first marked by surprise and then anger. For a brief moment I catch the same fires that consumed the world stirring within his eyes.{^n}{^n}In that instant the dream shattered and I awoke out of breath and tangled in sweat-soaked sheets. But I knew that it was more than just a nightmare spurred by an overactive imagination. He saw me through the glass, just as I saw him. I bore witness to something I was never meant to see. And now my identity is compromised. I must leave this place. Get as far away as I can.{^n}{^n}I will head southeast, across the dark waters. Eerily familiar voices have been calling to me from that area for some time. I don't know why, but in my heart I am certain that safe haven awaits me in the bog.

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA07Text=I am writing this for the record in the event that the High Advisor decides to dispose of me, as he already has with the others. I am beginning to fear that I have made a grave error in supporting Van Aldritch in this uprising.{^n}{^n}The initial plan was devious, but it made sense. Local sailors spread rumors of corruption and tax hikes while the city guard overlooked the crimes committed by my subordinates to stir up gossip. I became a bit uneasy when we started using the rumors about witches to smuggle women to Malmouth, but Aldritch reassured me that they would be well taken care of, and we were paid handsomely for each one, so I chose not to question it further.{^n}{^n}One evening, when we gathered to discuss future plans, Aldritch suddenly began acting very strange. He kept looking over his shoulder as if somebody were watching, and his expression became downright ghastly when he stared at the mirror hanging on my wall. He cut the meeting short and demanded that all future discussion be carried out via courier. Very strange, but I did not think much of it at the time. Figured the old man was getting paranoid as his plans came to fruition.{^n}{^n}That left me to deal with Captain Brastock directly. I have never met a more cruel and opportunistic man in my life, and I know every sailor that comes through these parts. I can't imagine it took much to convince him to join the High Advisor's schemes. He informed me that the reports of witches were coming in too slowly, so his men began planting weapons in people's homes to warrant arrests. Each ship sailing to Malmouth is now overflowing with would-be criminals. What Aldritch needs all these people for is beyond me.{^n}{^n}It was not until the day Aldritch asked me to transport several large boxes to him in high town though that I started to suspect that something was amiss. Seemed innocent enough at the time, until one of the crane ropes snapped and a crate dropped several feet onto the cobblestones. The wood splintered in several places and a sickening smell flared up our nostrils and made our skin crawl. The crate shook, as if something was alive in there. I could make out a faint green light through the cracks in the side. I had my men carry that thing out of my docks as soon as able.{^n}{^n}But it was not 'til the day of Captain Brastock's very bloody public execution that I began to suspect that we are all merely pawns in Aldritch's game and that in the end the only winner of this uprising would be none other than the High Advisor himself. Needless to say, I am keeping a close eye on the Mayor's offices and I doubled the pay of my bodyguards. Aldritch isn't going to get rid of me so easily.{^n}{^n}-Jarren, Port Valbury Harbormaster

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA08Name=The City is Rotting
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA08Text=Menhir have mercy. How much more can go wrong in this rotting city? When the dumping grounds in old town started overflowing with refuse, people started piling up their garbage in the streets. When that wasn't enough, the heavy rains flooded the dumps and caused the retaining walls to break, unleashing a deluge of filth and rot into the district. Those that haven't already left are getting sick. Soon there won't be anyone left in the oldest part of town.{^n}{^n}To make matters worse, the city guard has begun rounding up anybody that speaks up about the recent catastrophes. They search our carts and our homes without asking. Many blatantly steal and look us in the eye as they do it, as if daring us to lash out. If you resist, they arrest you. If they suspect you of plotting against the authorities, they arrest you. Is there no justice left in Valbury?{^n}{^n}I stopped by Owald and Helen's home the other day to find their door broken in and marked with a strange symbol. I'm told Helen was a suspected witch and Owald was taken in for questioning for harboring her all these years. I've never heard a more preposterous thing. I left quickly lest somebody accuse me too.{^n}{^n}This was my home. But now it feels like a dark strange place. It no longer feels safe.

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA09Text=My dearest Naomi,{^n}{^n}I have kept no secrets from you, and you know I have lived a dark and treacherous life. From an early age I was trained to kill. Murder was my trade, the shadows my refuge. I truly believed that was all life had in store for me. But then I found happiness, I found you. Through you, I learned the joys of life, that there is more to me than a blade in the shadows. It was better than I ever deserved, but my old life came at a price. I made many powerful enemies. Enemies I cannot protect you from.{^n}{^n}Some men from my past dealings have come forward with an offer to hide us from those that would seek to harm you in order to get at me, if I do one last job for them. I cannot allow you to become a victim of my former self, so I must ask your forgiveness. I have to do something I swore to you that I would never do again.{^n}{^n}I am writing this letter because I have agreed to take on a very dangerous task. It will ensure your safety. Take the money I have left with this note. Use it to get out of the city and far from here. Do not tell anyone where you are going. If I succeed, I will find you. But if you never hear from me again I want you to live your life and know that you were the only light in my dark. Knowing that I've kept you safe is the only reward I need.{^n}{^n}All my love,{^n}{^n}Keval

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA10codexTitle=Paige Rehnaul - Part 1
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA10Text=Life has been good for us here in Port Valbury. Alden and I have been happily married for 3 years now. Our business is thriving and Alden was hopeful to get a second shop opened up in high town by this time next year. But he came home from the court disappointed. Apparently the mayor has been denying all requests for an audience and his newly appointed High Advisor dismissed Alden's appeal for a deed without even hearing his case.{^n}{^n}Now there's the mess with the garbage spilling out of the old dumping ground. Everyone I've asked doesn't seem to know anything about why trash has been redirected to the already full dump in our district. The new curfew also hasn't been kind to business as we've had to close down early each night.{^n}{^n}Omeer and Shara are both terrified. They think something is wrong and we should all leave the city. Alden says there's nothing to be concerned about.

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA11Text=Several of our neighbors have moved away. They've had enough of the growing garbage problem and the sudden surge in crime here in old town. Omeer and Shara are the latest to leave. Shara was crying when she begged us to come with them. But our business is here and we can't just pack up.{^n}{^n}Food around the city is starting to be rationed. Shops are closing. Alden and I are keeping our shop open, but he has started hiding cheese and other food down in the basement; just in case, he says. I wonder if maybe Shara was right. Maybe we should be leaving too.

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA12codexTitle=Paige Rehnaul - Part 3
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA12Text=Men broke into the shop. They cleaned out the store and shattered Alden's leg when he resisted. The bone was sticking right through the skin of his thigh and I don't know what to do. The only doctor is in high town, but the bridge has been blocked off by the guard. I wrapped it as best I could but it still bleeds occasionally.{^n}{^n}We've been hiding in the basement since that night. Alden wakes up from time to time, but he seems confused and feverish. We should have left weeks ago when the others did. Occasionally I hear someone entering upstairs and rummaging through the shelves. I hope that they don't discover the stairwell leading down here. I'm so scared.

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA13Text=Alden hasn't woken up in a day. I tried to make him eat or drink something, but he can't keep anything down. He is so pale. He is going to die soon. I think I have known this fact for days, but I just didn't want to believe it.{^n}{^n}The looters have stopped coming by, likely because there is nothing left to steal. I've braved the upstairs to see what has happened since the fighting stopped and the sight was terrifying to behold. Parts of the city are burning. Most of the homes are abandoned or destroyed. One day, I witnessed a couple running between buildings with their child and a small sack of belongings. I should leave too, but I can't leave Alden.{^n}{^n}I don't understand how the city could turn to this so quickly. One moment, we were planning the next stages of our business, the next the city is in a state of war. The worst of it seems to be over though. It's been quiet, so quiet...

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA14codexTitle=Paige Rehnaul - Part 5
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA14Text=Last night I heard somebody scream. When I went upstairs to check, I saw some people wandering the streets. But it was a strange, aimless sort of walk. Nobody spoke. Then I heard the scream again and I turned my head to a most grisly sight. A putrid thing of foul flesh dragged a man out of some rubble and disemboweled him. I stifled a scream of my own and quickly ran back downstairs.{^n}{^n}All the commotion had caused my husband to stir and he stood up for the first time in days. But his eyes were glazed over and dull and his movements like the people outside. His skin was chalk white and his chest did not move with the rhythmic breathing of the living. Hands shaking, I grabbed the revolver he gave me and pointed it at his head. He did not talk; he did not even try to move out of the way. He just kept approaching me in a slow unsteady gait. At that moment I understood what wandered the streets outside and I clenched my tear-swollen eyes as I pulled the trigger.{^n}{^n}I can't sleep anymore. My husband's body lies next to me, a hole in his skull. There is nothing left for me here. It's time to go before no hope of escape remains, before my strength has left me. I have to run until my legs can carry me no further; away from Valbury, away from my shattered life.

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA15Name=A Change of Plans
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA15Text=I regret to report that our initial efforts in subduing the ruling vessel of Port Valbury have proven unsuccessful. Contrary to previous expectations, this mortal does not exhibit many of the usual vices and mental flaws that allow us to usurp the mind and assume control.{^n}{^n}I believed his lighthearted and jovial demeanor to mean he didn't care about the city and was only interested in the lavish parties and extravagant lifestyle.  This would have been an excellent weakness to exploit, but his outward persona is a mask that masterfully concealed a very sharp mind. Evidently, this is part of his political strategy and has led many an adversary to underestimate him.{^n}{^n}Although my efforts have proven futile, they were not entirely without success for I have found my way into the mind of the mayor's trusted advisor who they call Van Aldritch. He is a petty and scheming man who already harbored desires for the vaunted position we sought in Port Valbury. With a few suggestions, I had entered his mind. He belongs to us now.{^n}{^n}This vessel has many valuable connections within the city, which I had used to orchestrate assassination attempts upon the mayor. While those too proved unsuccessful, they have caused the mayor to become increasingly paranoid and fearful for his wellbeing. As a direct approach seems to be out of the question, I have begun stirring the locals in the interest of destabilizing the region. To facilitate matters, I've used my position to subtly push the mayor's decisions in the direction that suits us so that the growing dissent goes unnoticed until it is far too late.{^n}{^n}While this is contrary to our usual methods, I am confident that Port Valbury will be ready for the imminent Glorious Dawn and no adjustments will be necessary to our established timeline.{^n}{^n}-Van Aldritch, High Advisor of Port Valbury

tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA16Name=A Consensus Overruled
tagLoreObj_AetherialCity_NoteA16Text=I must express my disappointment in the consensus to redirect the vessel Theodin Marcell to the strategically insignificant region of Homestead. While I realize that the unexpected, and still unexplained, sudden disappearance of Anasteria has left the region woefully unsupervised, I believe the attention of the Shaper of Flesh is better served in Malmouth, where his grand work can continue without interruption.{^n}{^n}I understand that splintering the Black Legion's attention between Fort Ikon and the farmlands will be instrumental to their final destruction, but surely such an indelicate matter as the extermination of vermin can be taken upon by a vessel of lesser importance? I anticipate your reply in this matter in due haste so that a new consensus can be achieved without delay and the Shaper of Flesh returned to Malmouth.{^n}{^n}-Overlord Aldritch of Port Valbury


#Witch God Shrine Notes
tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA01Name=The Hidden Path - Dreeg
tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA01Text=Welcome, seeker of the truth, to this bastion of knowledge. You have taken your first step along the way to the deeper truths, as countless brothers and sisters have before you. The path now presented to you is a treacherous one. You will be persecuted for your practices, hunted like a rodent by the empire's Luminari hounds; but to persevere, to endure the trials that our patron Lords have endured, that is the way to true power through the eldritch realm.{^n}{^n}You stand before the shrine of Dreeg, the oldest of the three Witch Gods. The Great Guardian sought to know all, to see the truth behind the veil that blinds us all. In arrogance, or perhaps foresight, he cast aside the ancient warnings and the cautionary words of his peers. Dreeg reached into the veil and witnessed the workings of the gods themselves. For his hubris, he was struck blind, but it was then that his eyes had become truly open. Exposed to the wild magic of the eldritch realm, he was forever changed. Cruel spines pierced his flesh, acidic blood dripping from the festering wounds for all eternity. What emerged from beyond the veil bore little resemblance to the man that entered. Dreeg was reborn...a god.{^n}{^n}Dreeg now watches over us all, his peerless gaze pierces through our very souls and sees us for who we really are. To stand before the Great Guardian is an honor without match, to hear His voice is a blessing from the heavens themselves. If you are indeed deserving of his attention, then follow the way of the Three: travel to the broken lands beyond the Arkovian border, where harpies feast on the flesh of the unworthy. Seek a path blocked by stone. If you carry the message of Dreeg, the way shall open before you.

tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA02Name=The Hidden Path - Solael
tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA02Text=You have traveled far, seeker, and seen much, but still the veil between worlds blinds you to the deeper truths. You stumble about the world we inhabit, eager for answers that the Empire and its Luminari deny. They think us heretics, followers of false gods, and yet none of them can claim to have witnessed the power of their deities. Their...illusions.  Show me the cripples that Menhir has cured; the armies that Oleron has toppled; the beasts that Mogdrogen spared from the hunt. You cannot, because they are not real. But the Witch Gods, born of man, had ascended to raise us from our own ignorance. If you are willing to listen, they may open your eyes as well.{^n}{^n}You now stand before the shrine of Solael, the youngest of the Three. Eldritch fire is at his behest, the very essence of the eldritch realm his to mold and shape as he sees fit. Clothed in black robes that hide his gaunt frame, Solael glides unseen through the shadowy veil to hunt unwitting mortals for their vitality. Many a devout of Solael had been asked to make the ultimate sacrifice, to present themselves before the dark god and offer their life so that Solael may bestow his infinite wisdom upon those that remain.{^n}{^n}You, worthy seeker, do not yet have the attention of the gods, but know that with each step you take you bring yourself closer to the Three. Go now to the frozen lands of the north, where primitive tribes had constructed standing stones ages ago. Armed with the words of Solael and Dreeg, the way shall be opened to you.

tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA03Name=The Hidden Path - Desecrated
tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA03Text=The sight before you may bring you pause, seeker, and rightfully it should for the ignorant followers of Mogdrogen had found their way here. The defilers entered our ritual grounds, befouled the shrine and threatened our secrets. Revenge was swift and justified. Know that their entrails littered the valley, what remained scattered for the mountain yetis to fight over.{^n}{^n}Fear not, seeker of the Hidden Path, for the way forward is secured. Return to the Asterkarn Road and follow it Southeast. Underneath the Legion ramparts, the marked stone awaits. If you are truly sent here by the Three, then the way to Bysmiel shall open to you.

tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA04Name=The Hidden Path - Bysmiel
tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA04Text=At last, brave seeker, you arrive at the final shrine, the sacred grounds of Bysmiel the Schemer. Through her vast web of servants, Bysmiel tugs on the strings of fate that bind us all. It was she who taught the first occultists in the art of binding eldritch beings and it is through her machinations that the empire is still aimlessly hunting us to this day, their inquisitors confounded by the endless weave of decoys and dead ends. Only a chosen few are privileged to witness even a portion of the Schemer's vast network, and even they could never comprehend it in its entirety if given the opportunity.{^n}{^n}By reaching this far, you too are now a part of Bysmiel's web, forever bound to what you have seen and heard. In your hands you now possess the secret to the Temple of the Three. If you are prepared to commit your very existence to the Witch Gods, then follow the clues contained therein. Your destiny awaits you at the sanctum.

tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA05Name=The Runes Fall Silent
tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA05Text=The runes are extinguished one by one; and with each one gone another of my informants falls to the calamity that has consumed the Capital. The world crumbles around us and the temple walls shake with outrage. The Three are not pleased by the incursion. Twice now I have seen heralds thrown out of the Attendant's chamber, their eye sockets hollow with eldritch flame. No, they are not pleased at all.{^n}{^n}Already I can hear scheming whispers among the servants of Solael, wondering if the time has come for us to dissolve the Covenant and seek our own opportunities in this new reality that we face. I dismiss this as the rationale of terrified fools. It is of no concern; the most vocal dissenters had already been offered at Solael's altar. The thralls of Dreeg are as cryptic as ever, their mad ramblings speak of tides of blood shifting in a vast emptiness. They claw at their faces and tear out their hair, their minds barely able to withstand the presence of their god. But it would take someone far wiser and more experienced than I to unravel the disturbing messages Dreeg imparts upon his followers.{^n}{^n}My concerns are only with the weave. With our informants gone silent, we have become blinded to the outside world. The lady Bysmiel demands word from Erulan, but I have nothing to offer. I am beginning to fear that it is my eyes the Attendant will claim next.{^n}{^n}Karrin Taros, Servant of Bysmiel

tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA06Name=Ramblings of Ughdar
tagLoreObj_WitchGods_NoteA06Text=Twice the moon has waned, the Great Eye weeps with tears of blood. The seas rage and the waters run red. The others had fallen silent, but yet the words remain, painted clear on the wall with gore. I study them, but their meaning eludes me. I study them yet I am no wiser. Tell me, great Guardian, what truth escapes me? What does Dreeg desire of this frail form of flesh and bone?{^n}{^n}Your infinite gaze reaches out across the realm. It has seen the unseen. It has witnessed the green flame devour all. Its tendrils threaten our walls, our beliefs, our fates. Tell me, Master of Secrets, what must be done? The blood of the unwilling that I spilled in your name has run dry in my search for your voice. Have you too fallen silent to our pleas?{^n}{^n}The quiet is too quiet. The voices are gone. I must hear their chattering sermons once more or I shall go mad! I must see beyond what I can see. If the gods will not come to me, than I shall seek them where they lay dreaming.{^n}{^n}Ughdar Claz, Servant of Dreeg
