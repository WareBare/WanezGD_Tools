When you collect this item, you will gain a bonus to the Progress Bar and gain a temporary buff that increases your Damage and Survivability.{^n}{^n}Collecting another soul refreshes the duration of this effect and makes it stronger. The deeper you are in the Shattered Realm, the more stacks of this buff you can collect at once.
