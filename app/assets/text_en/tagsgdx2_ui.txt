tagFactionUser13=Cult of Bysmiel
tagFactionUser13Info=Headquarters: Conclave of the Three {^n}{^n} Worshipping the elusive Lady of Whispers, the Cult of Bysmiel prides itself on manipulation and subterfuge. {^n}{^n} It was by Bysmiel's machinations that the empire's inquisitors spent centuries aimlessly hunting for the Witch God cults, their efforts confounded by the endless weave of decoys and lies. {^n}{^n} All this is made possible through a vast network of spies and informants, known as Bysmiel's web. Only a select few are trusted in knowing the full span of Bysmiel's schemes.

tagFactionUser14=Cult of Dreeg
tagFactionUser14Info=Headquarters: Conclave of the Three {^n}{^n} Bestowed true sight by the Great Guardian, the worshippers of Dreeg are consumed by visions of possible futures. Many are driven mad by the whispers, but those that endure become invaluable assets capable of altering future events in the pursuit of the Witch Gods' goals. {^n}{^n} Dreeg's worshippers say that to stand before the Great Guardian is a blessing without match. His words of wisdom echo through the eons as he seeks to strike a balance in the tumultuous strands of fate woven by the celestials themselves. It is said that none can witness Dreeg's warped form in person without their feeble mortal mind shattering.

tagFactionUser15=Cult of Solael
tagFactionUser15Info=Headquarters: Conclave of the Three {^n}{^n} The very essence of the Eldritch Realm is for Solael to mold as he sees fit, and he shares this knowledge with his loyal servants. But such power does not come without sacrifice. Some must die so that others can bask in his glory, the ultimate display of loyalty. {^n}{^n} The worshippers of Solael would pay any price to taste of Solael's gifts. They say that the Eldritch Fire is without equal and worth spilling a little blood, even if it has to be the blood of their own...or their allies.

tagFactionUser16=Eldritch Horrors
tagFactionUser16Info= Eldritch creatures were capable of entering Cairn through tears in the veil for centuries, but in the Korvan lands the barrier between realities seems to be at its weakest. {^n}{^n} Here the terrors are numerous and their forms unlike any seen in other parts of Cairn. They strike with tooth and claw teeming with Eldritch energies and swoop down on unsuspecting prey upon armored wings. {^n}{^n} The Eldritch Realm is said to be the domain of the Witch Gods, but in the Korvan lands there appear to be others vying for control of its secrets, and their servants are merely awaiting the summons.
